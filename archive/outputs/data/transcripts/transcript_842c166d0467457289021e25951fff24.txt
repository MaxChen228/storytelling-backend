<Person1> Welcome to PODCASTIFY – Your Personal Generative AI Podcast! Today, we're diving deep into some thrilling news for all anime enthusiasts, especially fans of a certain devil-hunting protagonist.
</Person1><Person2> Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about! The <lang xml:lang="ja-JP">劇場版『鏈鋸人 蕾潔篇』, or as it's known in English, CHAINSAW MAN – THE MOVIE: REZE ARC! The excitement is just palpable, isn't it?
</Person2><Person1> Absolutely, Person2! It's one of the most anticipated releases of 2025. For the first time ever, the beloved Chainsaw Man series is hitting the big screen as a feature film. That's a huge deal!
</Person1><Person2> It really is! And it's not just any arc they're adapting, it's the highly acclaimed "Reze Arc." You know, the one with Denji's "super unbelievably cute!" new acquaintance. What makes this particular arc so compelling for a movie adaptation, in your opinion?
</Person2><Person1> Well, the "Reze Arc" is, um, a fan favorite for a reason. It perfectly blends that raw, chaotic action Chainsaw Man is known for with a really poignant, albeit, uh, twisted, emotional core. It's a tale of 'pure love' entangled with 'slaughter'. That dichotomy, that contrast, it just screams cinematic potential, don't you think?
</Person1><Person2> It absolutely does. And it's quite clever how it picks up right after the first season of the TV anime. No waiting for a second season, just straight into a movie that promises to be Denji's most deadly challenge yet. It's, like, instant gratification for the fans.
</Person2><Person1> Exactly. And the global release schedule is fascinating. We've got Japan on September 19th, 2025. Then, just a few days later, Taiwan on September 24th, and Hong Kong on September 25th. It's almost a near-simultaneous worldwide rollout for key regions, which is fantastic for building hype.
</Person1><Person2> Yeah, that's incredibly smart from a marketing perspective. Keeping the global buzz synchronized. Now, let's talk about the production side. MAPPA is back, which is, uh, a relief, given their reputation for stellar animation quality.
</Person2><Person1> Absolutely, Person2. MAPPA's involvement assures us that visual fidelity we've come to expect will be maintained. However, there's a notable change in the director's chair. Tatsuya Yoshihara is taking over from Ryu Nakayama. What are your thoughts on that transition?
</Person1><Person2> Hmm, that's a point of interest, isn't it? While Yoshihara is certainly a talented director, known for his dynamic action sequences, you know, sometimes a change in director can subtly shift the, uh, the tone or pacing. Are fans generally, like, optimistic about this change given Nakayama's work on the first season?
</Person2><Person1> That's a fair point, and it's something fans definitely noticed when it was announced. However, Yoshihara has a strong track record, particularly with action-heavy projects. The decision to bring him in for an arc as explosive as Reze's suggests a deliberate focus on intensifying those action sequences. It's less about a shift in tone and more about doubling down on what makes Chainsaw Man so visceral.
</Person1><Person2> I see, interesting. So, it's a strategic move to lean into the action. Makes sense for a big screen debut. And the voice cast! Reina Ueda as Reze is, like, perfect casting, especially given Denji's description of her. And the original crew—Kikunosuke Toya as Denji, Tomori Kusunoki as Makima, Shogo Sakata as Aki, Fairouz Ai as Power—they're all returning. That's, uh, critical for continuity, right?
</Person2><Person1> Precisely. Maintaining that established vocal performance is crucial for fan immersion. And the addition of powerhouse voice actors like Hidenori Takahashi, Kenji Akabane, Kenji Nomura, and Eri Kitamura for new roles, including the Typhoon Devil, just rounds out what's already a stellar ensemble.
</Person1><Person2> Indeed. But let's get to what might be one of the biggest talking points, besides the plot itself: the music. Kenshi Yonezu for the opening theme "IRIS OUT" is already massive news. But then, you add Hikaru Utada to the mix for the ending theme, "JANE DOE"... that's just a dream collaboration, isn't it?
</Person2><Person1> A dream collaboration, Person2! It's truly monumental! Kenshi Yonezu writing and composing "JANE DOE" with Hikaru Utada on vocals for their first-ever collaboration? I mean, Yonezu himself said that as he was creating it, he just felt like 'this song could only be for Utada.' That's a testament to the sheer synergy they achieved!
</Person1><Person2> Wow, that's a powerful statement. When artists of that caliber express such a sentiment, you know it's going to be something special. And the fact that it's a double A-side single, "IRIS OUT / JANE DOE," releasing on September 24th, 2025, just five days after the Japanese premiere? They're making it easy for fans to get their hands on it!
</Person2><Person1> Right? And with the added bonus of a lottery entry for Kenshi Yonezu's 2026 tour tickets, they're really enticing fans to pick up the CD. It's a smart cross-promotion that elevates the whole package.
</Person1><Person2> Yeah, that's incredibly clever. So, you've got this highly anticipated arc, a director known for action, MAPPA's visual quality, a stellar returning cast, and then you just drop Yonezu and Utada on the soundtrack. It feels like they're pulling out all the stops for this first movie, doesn't it?
</Person2><Person1> They absolutely are. And the journey to this announcement has been quite a ride. From the initial production announcement at Jump Festa 2024 in December 2023, to the new trailer and visual at Jump Festa 2025, then the concrete release dates unveiled at Anime Japan 2025, and finally the theme song reveal just recently in August 2025. It's been a meticulously planned rollout.
</Person1><Person2> A very deliberate and suspenseful buildup, for sure. It really highlights how much this film is expected to be a major event. So, to wrap it all up, what do you think are the absolute biggest reasons for the incredibly high anticipation surrounding CHAINSAW MAN – THE MOVIE: REZE ARC?
</Person2><Person1> Well, for starters, it's the first Chainsaw Man film, bringing a fan-favorite arc to life. Then there's the truly luxurious music lineup with Yonezu and Utada—a collaboration that still gives me chills! Plus, you know, MAPPA's commitment to high-quality production, and the near-global simultaneous release strategy. It's everything fans could ask for, packaged into what promises to be an explosive cinematic experience.
</Person1><Person2> It sounds like 2025 is going to be a fantastic year for Chainsaw Man fans worldwide. I'm already counting down the days!
</Person2><Person1> Me too, Person2, me too! And that's all the exciting details we have on the <lang xml:lang="ja-JP">劇場版『鏈鋸人 蕾潔篇』 for today. Thank you for tuning in to PODCASTIFY – Your Personal Generative AI Podcast!</Person1>
