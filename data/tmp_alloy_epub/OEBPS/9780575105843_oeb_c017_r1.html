<p class="normal-a"><span class="dropcap">W</span>axillium rode alone in the cold cargo railcar, shoulder wet with fake blood, listening to the wheels thump over the tracks beneath him. A swinging lamp hung where he’d placed it on a hook in the ceiling, near a corner. He’d also secured the webbing of nets on the ceiling, tucked up and held in place by special hooks affixed with industrial tape. It felt good to have all of that removed from wrapping around his legs, thighs, and fake paunch. His guard’s uniform, now much too large for him, lay in a heap in the corner, and he wore a utilitarian pair of suit pants and a light black jacket instead.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He sat on the floor, back to the side of the cargo container, legs stretched out. He held Vindication in his hand, absently spinning the cylinder and hitting the switch to lock it on to the special chambers. He had two of each type of hazekiller round in his pocket, and had loaded a Coinshot round and a Pewterarm round into the special chambers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He still had his earring in.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>You wanted me to do this</em>, he thought toward Harmony. Did an accusation count as a prayer? <em>Well, here I am. I’ll expect a little help, if that’s acceptable to your immortal plan, and all that</em>.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_261"/>The cargo box was beside him. He could see why House Tekiel was so proud of the job they’d done; the welded strongbox would be ridiculously difficult for thieves to steal. Getting it out of the car would require hours spent cutting it free with a gas torch or a large electric saw. That, plus the clever door and the supposed existence of guards, would make for a daunting—perhaps impossible—robbery.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Yes, the Tekiels had been clever. Problem was, they were thinking about this all wrong.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Waxillium pulled a package from beneath his coat. The dynamite and detonator that Wayne had found. He set the package beside him on the floor, then eyed his pocket watch. <em>Right about now …</em></p>
<p class="bodytext-2">The train suddenly started to slow.</p>
<p class="normal-a">“Yup,” Wayne said, looking through the spyglass as he crouched against the hillside. “He’s right. Wanna see?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi took the spyglass nervously. The two of them were in position following a hasty gallop out of the city. She felt naked, wearing a pair of Ranette’s trousers. <em>Completely</em> improper. Every man they passed would stare at her legs.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>Maybe that will stop the Vanishers from shooting</em>, she thought with a grimace. <em>They’ll be too distracted</em>. She raised the spyglass to her eye. She and Wayne were atop a hill along the railway route, outside of the City. It was nearly midnight when the train had finally come chugging along.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Now it was slowing, and the brakes caused screeches and sparks in the night. Ahead of the train, a ghostly apparition was approaching in the opposite direction, a bright light shining in front of it. She shivered. The phantom railcar.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Wax’ll be happy,” Wayne said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What?” she asked. “About the phantom?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“No. There’s mist tonight.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She started, realizing that it was forming in the air. The mist wasn’t like a normal fog; it didn’t come rolling in over the ocean. It <a id="page_262"/>grew in the air, sprouting like frost on a cold piece of metal. She shivered as it began to envelop them, giving the headlamps below a ghostly cast.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She focused the spyglass on the approaching train. Because she’d been warned what to look for, and because of her angle, she could easily see the truth. It <em>was</em> a decoy. A hand-propelled rail wagon behind a wooden engine facade.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“How do they make the light work?” she said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I dunno. Magic?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She snorted, trying to get a good look at what was behind the framework. “Must be some kind of chemical battery. I’ve read of the work … but Rust and Ruin, that’s a <em>powerful</em> light. I doubt they can run it for long.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">As the real train pulled to a halt, some men sprang from its sides. House Tekiel had sent guards. That gave Marasi a smile. Maybe the robbery wouldn’t happen after all.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The front portion of the phantom train dropped.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Aw, <em>hell</em>,” Wayne said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What is—”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She was cut off by a loud series of shots, incredibly fast. She jumped back by reflex, ducking down, though nothing was aimed at them. Wayne grabbed the spyglass, raising it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi couldn’t make out what happened next through the darkness and the mists. And she was glad. The shots continued, and she heard men screaming.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Rotary gun,” Wayne said softly. “Damn, these people are <em>serious</em>.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I have to help,” Marasi said, unslinging the rifle Ranette had given her. It was of an unfamiliar make, but the woman swore it would be more accurate than anything Marasi had ever used. She raised the rifle. If she could hit the Vanishers …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Wayne took the barrel of her rifle in one hand, gently pushing it down. The rotary gun stopped firing, and the night grew silent.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There’s nothing you can do, mate, and we don’t want to draw the attention of that damn rotary. Besides, you really think you can hit one of them from all the way up here?”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_263"/>“I’ve hit red at five hundred paces.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“At night?” Wayne said. “In the mists?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi fell silent. Then she held out her hand and gestured impatiently for the spyglass. Wayne gave it to her, and she watched six men hop from the phantom train. They walked along the sides of the real train, guns at the ready and watching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Distraction?” Wayne asked, watching.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Lord Waxillium thought so. He said to …” She trailed off.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He said to watch the canal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She turned, scanning the canal with the spyglass. Something big and dark was floating down it. Shrouded in mists, it looked like some kind of massive beast—a leviathan swimming quietly through the water. It came up to the middle of the train, then halted. A dark, shadowy leg lifted from the black mass. <em>By the Survivor</em>, she thought, shivering. <em>It’s alive</em>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But no … the leg was too stiff. It moved up, rotated out, then came down. As the thing in the canal stopped, the leg clamped into place on the shore. <em>For stabilization</em>, Marasi realized. <em>That’s what made the depression in the ground we saw earlier</em>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Once the thing … the machine … was stabilized, some men moved through the darkness to the vault car. They worked for a few moments. Then a large arm rose out of the dark mass on the canal. It swung over toward the tracks, then reached down, grabbed the entire vault car, and <em>lifted</em> it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi gaped. The car was lifted only a few feet, but that was enough. The machine was a crane.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Vanishers who had unhooked the couplers helped push the train car over across the narrow strip of land toward the canal. The black mass had to be a barge. Marasi ran some quick numbers in her head. In order to lift the train car like that, the barge must be very heavy and have considerable ballast on the other side.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She lifted her spyglass and was pleased to be able to pick out another crane arm extending in the other direction, holding some kind of heavy weight. The barge sank somewhat into the waters as the vault car was lifted, but not as far as Marasi would have assumed. It <a id="page_264"/>probably was designed with some means of bottoming out in the canal, perhaps an extendable section underneath the barge. That, plus the stabilizing arm, might be enough.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“My, my, my …” Wayne whispered. “Ain’t that somethin’.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The machine dropped the entire vault car onto its barge, and then lifted something else off. Something large and rectangular. She had already guessed what to expect. A replica.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi watched as the duplicate railcar was lowered onto the tracks. The couplings made it <em>very</em> tricky. This could ruin their entire plan; lower the car in the wrong way, ruin a coupler, and when the train pulled away it would leave its back half on the tracks. That would make it more obvious what had happened. The Vanishers on the ground guided the process.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Several of the other Vanishers were firing shots through the windows of a passenger car a few places ahead, probably to keep anyone from peeking out. However, the way the tracks bent around a tree-topped hill here, it would be very difficult for anyone inside to get a good view of what was happening. The phantom railcar’s light had vanished a few moments ago, and she knew it would be speeding backward along the tracks. Where did they keep it hidden? Perhaps it was loaded onto another barge after getting far enough ahead to be out of sight?</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Vanishers who had been working with the barge were running over to climb back onto their vehicle, which was slipping out into the center of the wide canal, where it was practically invisible in the misty night. It moved as a shadow.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Wayne!” she said, scrambling up. “We’ve got to go.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">He sighed, standing. “Sure, sure.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Waxillium is <em>in that train car</em>!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yeah. You ever notice how often he gets to be the one who rides in comfort, while I have to do things like gallop or walk all the time? Not very fair.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She slung the rifle on her shoulder, hurrying down the hill. “You know, when I was reading the reports, I never imagined that you’d complain this much.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_265"/>“Now, that’s not fair. I’ll have you know that I pride myself on my cheery, optimistic attitude.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She stopped, looking back at him, raising an eyebrow. “You pride yourself on it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">He raised a hand to his chest, adopting a tone that sounded almost priestly. “Yes, but pride is bad, you know. I’ve been trying to be more humble lately. Hurry up, hurry up. We’re gonna lose them. You want Wax to be cornered and alone? Gosh, woman.”</p>
<p class="bodytext-2">She shook her head, turning and continuing down the hillside to where their horses were tied.</p>
<p class="normal-a">Miles stood with hands clasped behind his back, riding on the front of the Machine as it slid quietly down the canal. The part crane, part barge wasn’t exactly what he’d envisioned when he’d explained his plot to Mister Suit, but it was close.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He was proud of what he’d done: not just become a thief, but become one that captured people’s imaginations. Suit could say what he wanted about the theatrics, but they worked. The constables had no idea how he was performing the thefts.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“They checked on all six of the Tekiel guards, boss,” Tarson said, stepping up to him. His arm was out of its sling. Pewter savants could heal quickly. Not as quickly as someone like Miles, but it was still remarkable. Of course, pewter savants were also likely to run themselves to death, never noticing that their body was exhausted. It was a dangerous art that burned men up as quickly as Allomancers burned metal.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Engineers too,” Tarson continued. “They caught a few more guards in the last passenger car, trying to sneak out to see how we were getting the cargo. We shot them. I think that means we’re clean.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Not yet,” Miles said softly, staring forward into the darkness as they sailed through the mists, moving by way of a pair of slow-turning propellers underneath the barge. “Waxillium knows how we’re doing this.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_266"/>Tarson hesitated. “Uh … you sure?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes,” Miles said absently. “He’s inside the train car.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“What!” Tarson spun, looking at the large car riding in the middle of the barge. Miles could hear members of his team covering it with a tarp, to obscure it as they approached the City. They’d look like an ordinary barge, the arms and ballast hidden under other tarps and the whole thing disguised to look like a shipment of stone from one of the outer quarries. Miles even had a shipping manifest and docking authorization, along with a few tarps that actually hid piles of neatly cut stone.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t know the method he used,” Miles said. “But he’ll be in there. Wax thinks like a lawkeeper. This is the best way to find our hideout—stay with the cargo you know will be stolen, even if you’re not sure precisely how.” He paused. “No. He’ll have guessed how we’re doing it. That’s the risk of being as good as he is. As good as I was. You start to think like a criminal.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Better than a criminal, really.</p>
<p class="bodytext">In a way, it was surprising that more lawkeepers didn’t end up turning to crime. If you saw something done wrong frequently enough, you’d—by nature—want to see it finally done right. Miles had started planning these robberies in the back of his mind ten years ago, when he’d realized that railway security was focused on the railcars. At first it had been just a thought experiment. That was another thing to be proud of. He had robbed, and he’d done it well. Very well. And the people … he’d gone through the city, listening. They spoke with awe of the Vanishers.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They’d never treated him like that back in the Roughs. They’d hated him while he’d protected him. Now they loved him while he stole from him. People were baffling, but it felt good not to be hated. Feared, yes. But not hated.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“So what are we going to do?” Tarson asked.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Nothing,” Miles said. “Wax likely doesn’t realize I’ve guessed he’s there. That gives us an advantage.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But …”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_267"/>“We can’t open the railcar here,” Miles said. “That’s the entire point of the thing. We’ll need the workshop.” He paused. “Though I suppose we could just dump the entire car into the canal. It’s deep enough here to sink entirely. I wonder if Wax has a plan to open the door if something like that happens.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t think Mister Suit would much like us sinking the train car, boss,” Tarson said. “Not after what he must have spent to make that replica.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes. Unfortunately, the canal is only about fourteen feet deep. If we dumped the car, we’d never get it back out before another ship’s hull collided with it, revealing what we’ve done. Pity.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Waxillium’s death would almost be worth the loss of the cargo. Mister Suit didn’t realize how dangerous the man was. Oh, he <em>acted</em> like he did. But if he had really appreciated how dangerous, how <em>effective</em>, Waxillium was … well, he’d never have allowed this robbery. He’d have stopped all operations and pulled out of the city. And Miles would have agreed with the move, save for one thing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That would have meant no confrontation.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They floated into the City, carrying the train car, its cargo, and its occupant—almost as if Wax were a lord in his grand carriage. His was a nearly impregnable fortress that protected him from the dozen or so men on the barge who would happily have killed him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Mister Suit’s two minders—who called themselves Push and Pull—joined Miles at the front of the barge, but he didn’t speak to them. Together, they drifted through Elendel. Streetlights were lines of fire in the mists, bright white, running along the canal. Other lights sparkled high in the sky, the windows of buildings that were shrouded in the mist.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Nearby, some of his men were muttering. The mists were considered bad luck by most, though at least two of the major religions accepted them as manifestations of the divine. Miles had never been certain how to think of them. They made Allomancy stronger, or so some claimed, but his abilities were already as strong as they could be.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_268"/>The Church of the Survivor taught that the mists belonged to him, Kelsier, Lord of Mists. He appeared on nights when the mist was thick and gave his blessing to the independent. Whether they be thieves, scholars, anarchists, or a farmer who lived on his own land. Anyone who survived on his own—or who thought for himself—was someone who followed the Survivor, whether he knew it or not.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>That’s another thing the current establishment makes a mockery of</em>, Miles thought. Many of them claimed to belong to the Church of the Survivor, but discouraged their employees from thinking for themselves. Miles shook his head. Well, he no longer followed the Survivor. He’d found something better, something that felt more true.</p>
<p class="bodytext">They sailed down past the outer ring of the Fourth and Fifth Octants. Two massive buildings rose up opposite one another across the canal. The tops disappeared into the mists. Tekiel Tower was on one side, the Ironspine on the other.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The freight dock for the Ironspine was alongside its own branch from the canal. They steered the barge into it, gliding to a stop, then used the dock’s stationary crane to lift the hidden train car off the barge. It was supposed to be a big pile of rock, after all. They slowly swung it into the air, then over and gently down onto the platform.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles jumped off the barge and onto the ground and walked to the platform, joined by Push and Pull. The rest of his men filed in around him, looking very pleased. Some were joking with one another about the bonus they’d get for the heist.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Clamps looked very disturbed, and he scratched at the scars on his neck. He was a Survivorist, his scars a mark of devotion. Tarson just yawned a wide, gray-lipped yawn, then cracked his knuckles.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The entire platform shook, then began to move, descending one story into the foundry hall. Once they passed through, the doors closed above. The lift lurched slightly as it came to a stop. Miles looked to the side, down the long tunnel that Mister Suit claimed <a id="page_269"/>would someday provide train access under the city. It looked hollow, empty, lifeless.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Hook up the chains,” Miles said, hopping off the platform. “Fix the train car in place.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Couldn’t we just wait?” Tarson asked, frowning. “It’ll open in twelve hours, right?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I plan to be gone in twelve hours,” Miles said. “Wax and his people are too close. We’re going to crack that car open, deal with whoever’s inside, then grab the aluminum and go. Get to work; let’s rip the door off.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">His men hastened to obey, tying the large train car to the wall with a large number of clamps and chains. Another set of chains was hooked to the Breaknaught’s door; these chains wrapped around the same powerful electric winching mechanism that raised and lowered the platform. The platform shook as it was disengaged, the motors instead engaging the chain wheels.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles walked to the gun rack, selecting two aluminum handguns identical to the ones in his holsters. He was disturbed to notice that there was only one other gun on the rack. They’d lost a fortune in weaponry. Well, he’d just have to see that Waxillium was duly repaid. Miles strode through the room, chains clinking on the floor and men grunting. The air smelled of coke from the inactive forges.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Arm up!” Miles ordered. “Get ready to fire on the person inside the moment we open the thing.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Vanishers glanced at one another, confused, but then unslung or unholstered guns. He had about a dozen of them here, with some others in reserve. Just in case. Never put all your bullets in the same gun when Waxillium was around.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But boss,” one of the Vanishers called, “the report said the train left without the guards inside!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles cocked his gun. “If you find a building without rats, son, then you know that something more dangerous scared them away.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You think he’s in there?” Push said in a near monotone, stepping <a id="page_270"/>up beside him. Obviously, he hadn’t heard Miles’s conversation about Wax on the barge.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles nodded.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“And you brought him here.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles nodded again.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Push’s face darkened. “You should have told us.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You were given to me to help deal with him,” Miles said. “I just wanted to see you boys get your chance.” He turned. “Start the motor!”</p>
<p class="bodytext">One of the men pulled the lever, and the chains grew taut. They groaned, pulling against the door. The train car rattled, but was kept in place by the other chains behind.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Be ready!” Miles called. “When the door opens, fire at anything that so much as <em>quivers</em> inside that car. Arm yourselves <em>only</em> with aluminum, and don’t save ammunition. We can collect the bullets later and recast them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The train’s door buckled in its mountings, the metal groaning. Miles and his men moved out to the sides, away from the path of the chains. Three hastily went to set up the rotary gun, but Miles waved them down. They didn’t have aluminum bullets for that, so firing it could be a disaster against a prepared Coinshot.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles refocused his attention on the vault car. He stilled his breath and felt his body grow warm as he increased the power he was tapping from his metalmind. He didn’t need to breathe. His body renewed itself each moment. He’d stop his heartbeat if he could. A heartbeat was such an annoyance when trying to aim.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Even without breathing, he’d never been able to shoot as well as Wax. Of course, nobody could. The man seemed to have an inborn instinct for firearms. Miles had seen him make shots he’d have sworn were impossible. It almost seemed a shame to kill such a man. It would be like burning a one-of-a-kind painting, a masterpiece.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But it was what had to be done. Miles extended his arm, sighting with the revolver. The door continued to warp, and the links in several of the chains began to show strain. But there were enough of them, and the motor was strong enough, that the door’s bindings <a id="page_271"/>began to break. Scraps of metal sprang free, bolts snapping. One took Miles on the cheek, ripping skin. The cut regrew itself immediately. No pain. He only faintly remembered what pain felt like.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Then the door gave a final screech of death, ripping free and flying across the room. It hit the ground, spraying sparks and skidding as the man at the lever hastily stopped the engine. The door came to a rest between the Vanishers, who nervously trained their weapons on the dark interior of the car.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>Come on, Wax</em>, Miles thought. <em>Play your hand. You’ve come to me. Into my den, into my lair. You’re mine now</em>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Poor fool. Wax never could stop himself if a woman was in danger.</p>
<p class="bodytext">That was when Miles noticed the string. Thin, almost invisible, it led from the fallen door to the inside of the railcar. It must have been tied to the door, then set inside in a loose pile with lots of slack. When they yanked the door off, the string didn’t snap, but was strung out along behind. What …</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles glanced again at the fallen door. Tape. Dynamite.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>Aw, hell</em>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Someone inside the train car—hiding behind the box of aluminum—pulled the string tight with a sudden jerk.</p>
