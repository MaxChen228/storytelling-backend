<p class="normal-a"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ax is slippery,” Miles said, walking alongside Mister Suit through the dark tunnel connecting the dorms to the forging hall of the new lair. “He has lived so long precisely by learning to avoid being killed by people who are stronger and craftier than he is.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You shouldn’t have revealed yourself,” Suit said sternly.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I wasn’t about to shoot Wax without him seeing me, Suit,” Miles said. “He deserves more respect than that.” The words gnawed at him as he said them. He hadn’t mentioned the first shot he’d taken at Wax, the one while the man’s back had been turned. Nor had he mentioned the cloth of his mask, pushed back into his flesh by Wax’s bullet, making it hard to heal his eye. He’d needed to pull it free.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suit snorted. “And it’s said that the Roughs are the place where honor goes to be murdered.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s the place honor goes to be strung up, flayed within an inch of its life, then cut down and left in a desert. If it survives something like that, it’ll be stronger than hell. Certainly stronger than anything you have at your Elendel dinner parties.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That from a man who so readily went to kill a friend?” Suit <a id="page_238"/>said. The tone was still suspicious. He thought Miles had intentionally let Wax escape.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He didn’t understand at all. This wasn’t about the robberies any longer. The paths chosen by Wax and Miles had crossed. The future could only continue down one or the other.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Either Wax would die or Miles would. That would settle the matter. Roughs justice. The Roughs weren’t a simple place, but they <em>were</em> a place of simple solutions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Wax is <em>not</em> a friend,” Miles said, and truthfully. “We were never friends—no more than two rival kings could ever be friends. We respect each other, we did similar jobs, and we worked together. It ends there. I’ll stop him, Suit.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">They stepped out into the forging room and climbed the stairs up to the balcony that ran along the north side of the large chamber. They walked to the end and stopped beside a doorway, beyond which was the lift. “You are quickly becoming a liability, lawkeeper,” Suit said. “The Set does <em>not</em> like you, though—as of yet—I have continued to vouch for your effectiveness. Do not make me regret that. Many of my colleagues are convinced that you will turn against us.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles didn’t know if he would or not. He hadn’t decided. He basically only wanted one thing: vengeance. All of the best motives boiled down to a single, driving emotion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Vengeance for fifteen years in the Roughs, achieving nothing. If this city burned, maybe—for once—the Roughs would see some justice. And maybe Miles could see a government set up here in Elendel that wasn’t corrupt. A part of him acknowledged, however, that seeing them—the lords who ruled, the constables who pandered, the senators who spoke so grandly but did nothing of use to real people—cast down would be the most satisfying part.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The Set was part of the establishment. But then, they wanted revolution too. Perhaps he wouldn’t turn against them. Perhaps.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t like being in this place, Suit,” Miles said, nodding to the chamber where the Vanishers had set up. “It’s too close to the center of things. My men will be seen coming and going.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“We will move you soon,” Suit said. “The Set is in the process of <a id="page_239"/>acquiring a railway station. You are still committed to the job tonight?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I am. We need more resources.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“My colleagues question that,” Suit said. “They wonder why we went to so much trouble to outfit your men with aluminum, if it was only to be lost in a single fight without so much as killing one of the Allomancers who faced you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>It’s important</em>, Miles thought, <em>because I intended to use that aluminum to finance my own operations</em>. Now he was practically destitute, right back where he’d begun. <em>Damn you, Wax. Damn you straight to Ironeyes’ Tomb</em>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do your colleagues question what I’ve done for them?” Miles said, drawing himself up. “Five of the women they wanted are in your possession, all without a speck of suspicion attached to you and the Set. If you wish that to continue, my men will be <em>properly</em> outfitted. A single Rioter could turn the entire bunch against one another.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suit eyed him. The slender old man did not walk with a cane, and his back was straight. He was not weak, despite his age and obvious fondness for fine living. The door to the lift opened. Two young men wearing black suits and white shirts walked out of it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The Set has agreed to this job tonight,” Suit said. “After it, you are to go to ground for six months and focus on recruitment. We will prepare another list of targets for you to acquire for us. When you return to activity, we will discuss whether or not the flamboyance of being the ‘Vanishers’ is required.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“The theatrics keep the constables from—”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“We will discuss it <em>then</em>. Will Wax try to interfere tonight?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’m counting on it,” Miles said. “If we try to hide, he’ll dig us out eventually. But it won’t come to that—he’ll figure out where we’re going to hit, and he’ll be there trying to stop us.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You are to kill him tonight, then,” Suit said, pointing to the two men. “The woman you took yesterday will remain here; use her as bait, if it comes to that. We don’t want to move her while that one has her trail. As for these two, they are to aid you in making certain everything goes smoothly.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_240"/>Miles gritted his teeth. “I don’t need help to—”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You <em>will</em> take them,” Suit said coldly. “You’ve proven unreliable with regard to Waxillium. It is not open for discussion.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Fine.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suit stepped closer, tapping Miles on the chest and speaking softly. “The Set is anxious, Miles. Our monetary resources are very limited at the moment. You may rob the train, but don’t bother with hostages. We will take half of the aluminum you steal tonight to fund several operations you need not know about. You can have the rest for weapons.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Have your two men there ever fought Allomancers?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“They are among our finest,” Suit said. “I think you’ll find them more than capable.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">They both knew what this was. Yes, the two would fight Wax, but they would also keep an eye on Miles. <em>Great</em>. More interference.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’m leaving the city,” Suit said. “Wax is getting too close. If you survive the night, send someone to update me.” He said that last part with a hint of a smile.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>Insufferable bastard</em>, Miles thought as Suit walked over to the lift, where a quartet of bodyguards waited. He was leaving on his regular train; he’d probably come back on his regular one too. He probably didn’t realize Miles had been tracking those.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Suit departed, leaving Miles with the two black-coated men. Well, he’d find some use for them.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He returned to the main chamber, followed by his new babysitters. The Vanishers—the thirty or so of them that remained—were getting ready for the job tonight. The Machine had been brought into the chamber via the far platform, which moved up to ground level in a large industrial lift, a majestic electrical wonder.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>The world is changing</em>, Miles thought, leaning down on the railing. <em>First railways, now electricity. How long before men take to the skies, as the Words of Founding say is possible?</em> The day might come where every man knew the freedom that had once been reserved only to Coinshots.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Change didn’t scare Miles. Change was an opportunity, a chance <a id="page_241"/>to become something you were not. No Augur was bothered by change.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Augur. He usually ignored that side of himself. His Feruchemy was what kept him alive—and these days he hardly noticed even that, save for the faint sense of extra <em>energy</em> to every step he took. He never got headaches, never felt tired, never had sore muscles, never dealt with colds or pain.</p>
<p class="bodytext">On a whim, he took hold of the banister and swung over, dropping to the floor some twenty feet below. For a brief moment, he knew that sense of freedom. Then he hit. One of his legs tried to break—he recognized the slight pop. But the bone’s fractures reknit as quickly as they broke, and so it never fully snapped, cracks opening on one side but resealing on the other.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He rose from a crouch, whole. The black-coated babysitters dropped beside him, one dropping a bit of metal and slowing a moment before he hit. A Coinshot. Well, that would be useful. The other surprised him, landing softly, but not dropping any metal. The ceiling had metal crossbeams. This man would be a Lurcher; he’d Pulled upon those beams to slow himself.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles strode through the room, inspecting the Vanishers as they prepared their gear. Every bit of aluminum they had left had gone for guns and bullets. They’d use those from the start this time. At the wedding-dinner fight, it had taken the men a few moments to switch weapons. Now they knew what to anticipate. Their numbers might be fewer, but they’d be much better prepared.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He nodded to Clamps, who was watching over the men. The scarred man nodded back. He was loyal enough, though he had joined up for the thrill of robbery rather than the purpose of any cause. Of them all, only Tarson—dear, brutal Tarson—had anything resembling true loyalty.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Clamps claimed to be dedicated, though Miles knew otherwise. Well, Clamps hadn’t been the one to fire the first shot in the last mess. For all Miles’s professions about wanting to change things, his temper—and not his mind—had eventually ruled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He should have been better than that. He was a man created to <a id="page_242"/>have a steady hand and an even steadier mind. Made by Trell, inspired by the Survivor, yet still weak. Miles questioned himself often. Was that the mark of a lack of dedication? He’d never done anything in his life without questioning.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He turned, studying his domain, such as it was. Thieves, murderers, and braggarts. He took a deep breath, then burned gold.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It was considered one of the least of the Allomantic metals. Far less useful than its alloy, which was in turn far less useful than one of the prime battle metals. In most cases, being a gold Misting was little better than being an aluminum Misting—a power so useless, it had become proverbial for one who did nothing.</p>
<p class="bodytext">But gold was not completely useless. Just mostly so. Upon burning it, Miles split. The change was visible only to his own senses, but for a moment, he was two people, two versions of himself. One was the man he had been. The angry lawkeeper, growing more bitter by the day. He wore a white duster over rugged clothing, with tinted spectacles to shade his eyes against the harsh sun. Dark hair kept short and greased back. No hat. He’d always hated those.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The other man was the man he’d become. Dressed in the clothing of a city worker—buttoned shirt and suspenders over dirty trousers with fraying cuffs. He walked with a slouch. When had that begun?</p>
<p class="bodytext">He could see through both pairs of eyes, think both sets of thoughts. He was two people at once, and each one loathed the other. The lawkeeper was intolerant, angry, and frustrated. He hated anything that broke with the strict order of the law, and meted out harsh punishments with no mercy. He had a special loathing for someone who had once followed the law, but had turned his back upon it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The robber, the Vanisher, hated that the lawkeeper let others choose his rules. There was really nothing sacred about the law. It was arbitrary, created by powerful men to help them hold power. The criminal knew that secretly, deep down, the lawkeeper understood this. He was severe toward criminals because he felt so impotent. Each day, life grew worse for the good people, the people who tried, and the laws did little to help them. He was like a man <a id="page_243"/>swatting mosquitoes while ignoring the gash in his leg, an artery open and throbbing gushes of blood onto the floor.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles gasped, and extinguished his gold. He felt weary, suddenly, and slumped back against the wall. His two minders watched him with emotionless expressions.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Go,” Miles said to them, waving a weak hand. “Check over my men. Use your Allomancy to determine if any of them accidentally left metal on their bodies. I want them clean.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The two men looked at each other. They didn’t behave as if they cared to obey him.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Go,” Miles said more firmly. “So long as you’re here, you should be useful.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">After another moment of hesitation, the two men walked away to do as ordered. Miles slumped down farther, back to the wall, breathing in and out.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>Why do I do that to myself?</em></p>
<p class="bodytext">There had been considerable speculation about what a gold Misting really saw when burning his metal. A past version of himself, certainly. Was it the person he had actually been? Or was it a person he might have become, if he’d chosen another branching path of his life? That possibility had always struck him as sounding reminiscent of the mythical lost metal, atium.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Either way, he liked to think that burning his gold on occasion helped him—that each time he did it, it let him take the best of what he had been and mix it with the best of what he could be. An alloy of himself, then.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It disturbed him how much the two people he became hated each other. He could almost feel it like an oven’s heat, radiating from coal and stone.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He stood back up. Some of the men were staring at him, but he didn’t care. He wasn’t like the criminal bosses he’d often arrested in the Roughs. They had to worry about looking strong in front of their men, lest they be killed by someone who wanted to seize power.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles couldn’t be killed, and his men knew it. He’d once put a shotgun to his own head in front of them to prove it.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_244"/>He walked over to a pile of trunks and boxes. A few were full of things Mister Suit had ordered stolen from Wax’s mansion, effects the man hoped would help them fight—or perhaps frame—the former lawkeeper. Suit had resisted killing Wax at first, for some reason.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Miles left them and walked around to the back side, where his own trunks had been deposited following the hasty evacuation of their old hideout. He picked through a few, then opened one. His white duster was inside. He took it out, shaking it, then got out a pair of sturdy Roughs trousers and a matching shirt. He slipped his tinted spectacles into the pocket, then went to change.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He’d been worried about hiding, worried that he’d be recognized and branded an outlaw. Well, an outlaw was what he had become. If this was the path he had chosen, he could at least walk it with pride.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>Let them see me for what I am</em>.</p>
<p class="bodytext-3">He would not turn from his course. It was too late to change one’s aim when the hammer was already falling. But it wasn’t too late to straighten his back.</p>
<p class="normal-a">Waxillium stared at the wall of Ranette’s sitting room. One side was piled with furniture, where she’d put things out of the way to make a handier pathway between her workshop and her bedroom. The other half of the room was strewn with boxes of various kinds of ammunition, bits of scrap metal, and cast barrels for gun making. There was dust everywhere. Very like her. He’d asked her for a way to prop up his paper pad, expecting her to find him an easel. She’d absently handed him some nails and pointed toward a hammer. So he’d just hung it on the wall, wincing as he drove the nails into the fine wood.</p>
<p class="bodytext">He stepped up, using a pencil to scribble a note to himself in the corner. The pile of shipping manifests that Wayne had brought lay to the side. Apparently, Wayne had left a gun he’d borrowed from Ranette in place of the manifests, considering it a fair trade. <a id="page_245"/>It had probably never occurred to him that a group of train engineers would be completely baffled to find their manifests gone and a pistol in their place.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>Miles will strike at Carlo’s Bend</em>, Wax thought, tapping the paper.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It had been easy to locate a shipment of aluminum. House Tekiel, tired of being robbed, was indeed making a large fuss over their new vault-style railway car. Wax could understand the reasoning; the Tekiels were best known as bankers, and their business relied on security and asset protection. The robberies been become a major embarrassment to them. They were intending to recover in a visible way.</p>
<p class="bodytext">It was almost like a dare to Miles and his Vanishers. Wax made another notation on his paper. The Tekiel shipment would follow a very direct route toward Doxonar. He’d mapped it, noting locations where the railway tracks wound close to one of the canals.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>I won’t be able to watch where we’re going</em>, Wax thought, making another notation. <em>I need to know exactly how far from the previous stop Carlo’s Bend is</em>….</p>
<p class="bodytext">There wasn’t much time to prepare. He fingered the earring in his left hand, running his thumb along its smooth side as he thought.</p>
<p class="bodytext">The door opened. Wax didn’t look up, but the sound of the footsteps was enough to tell him it was Marasi. Soft shoes. Ranette and Wayne both wore boots.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi cleared her throat.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Nets?” Wax asked, distractedly writing the number 35.17 on the paper.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I found some, finally,” she said, walking up beside him, looking over the notations. “You can make sense of this?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“For the most part. Except Wayne’s doodles.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“They … appear to be pictures of you. Unflatteringly ugly ones.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That’s the part that doesn’t make sense,” Waxillium said. “Everyone knows I’m irreparably handsome.” He smiled to himself. That was one of Lessie’s phrases. Irreparably handsome. She’d always claimed he’d look better with a nice scar on his face, after good Roughs fashion.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi smiled too, though her eyes were on his notations and <a id="page_246"/>scribbling. “The phantom railcar?” she asked, pointing to his drawing of a ghostly train coming down the tracks, alongside a diagram of how it had probably been made.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes,” he said. “Most of the attacks happened on misty nights, apparently to make it much easier to hide the fact that the phantom ‘train’ is really just a false front with a large headlamp, attached to a moving rail platform.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’re certain?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Reasonably,” Waxillium said. “They’re using the canals to attack, and so they need some sort of diversion to keep eyes off what is sneaking up behind.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She pursed her lips, thoughtful.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Was Wayne out there?” Waxillium asked.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, he’s bothering Ranette. I … honestly left the room because I worried she’d shoot him.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Waxillium smiled.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I picked up a broadsheet when I was out,” she said. “The constables have found the old hideout.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Already?” Waxillium said. “Wayne said we had until dark.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s dark already.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It is? Hell.” Waxillium checked his watch. They had less time than he’d thought. “It still shouldn’t be in the papers yet. The police found the hideout early.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi nodded toward his sketches. “This indicates that you know where the Vanishers will strike. I don’t want to pound a brittle metal, Lord Waxillium, but we really should tell the constables that fact.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I <em>think</em> I know where the attack will happen. If we let the constables know, they’ll flood the area and scare off Miles.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Wax,” she said, stepping closer. “I understand that independent spirit; it’s part of what makes you what you are. But we’re not in the Roughs. You don’t have to do this all by yourself.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I don’t intend to. I’ll involve the constables, I promise. Miles, however, is not an ordinary criminal. He knows what the constables will try, and he will watch for them. This has to be done at the <a id="page_247"/>right time, in the right way.” Waxillium tapped his notations on the wall. “I know Miles. I know how he thinks. He’s like me.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Almost <em>too</em> much so.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That means he can anticipate you too.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He undoubtedly will. I’ll anticipate him better.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">The moment Waxillium had drawn his gun and fired back against the Vanishers, he’d started down this path. Once he got his teeth into something, he didn’t let go.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You are right about me,” he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Right? I don’t believe I said anything about you, Lord Waxillium.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’re thinking it,” he said. “That I’m arrogant for wanting to do this my way, for not handing this over to the constables. That I’m foolhardy to not look for help. You’re right.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s not so bad as that,” she said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It’s not bad at all,” he said. “I <em>am</em> arrogant and foolhardy. I <em>am</em> acting like I’m still in the Roughs. But I’m also right.” He reached up, drawing a small square on the paper, then an arrow from it toward the precinct building.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I’ve written a letter for Ranette to send to the constables,” he continued. “It details everything I’ve discovered, and my guesses on what Miles will do, should I fail to best him. I won’t make any move tonight until we’re well away from the railway and any passengers. The Vanishers won’t take a hostage tonight. They’ll try to be as quick and as silent as possible.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“But it will still be dangerous. People might die, innocent ones. I’ll try my best to keep them from harm, and I firmly believe I have a better chance against Miles than the constables would. I realize that you are studying to be an attorney and a judge, and that your training mandates you should go to the authorities. Considering my plans, and my promises, will you refrain and help me instead?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>Harmony</em>, he thought. <em>She trusts me</em>. Too much, probably. He reached up, squaring off a box of notes. “This is your part.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I won’t be in the train car with you?” She sounded worried.</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_248"/>“No,” Waxillium said. “You and Wayne will watch from the hilltop.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’ll be alone.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I will.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She fell silent. “You knew what I was thinking of you. What are <em>you</em> thinking of <em>me</em>, Lord Waxillium?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">He smiled. “If the game is to work the same way, I can’t tell you my thoughts. You need to guess them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You are thinking about how young I am,” she said. “And you’re worried about having me involved, lest I be hurt.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Hardly a difficult guess. So far, I’ve given you what … three opportunities to abandon this course and seek safety?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You’re <em>also</em> thinking,” she said, “that you’re glad I insist on staying, because I will be useful. Life has taught you to use the resources you have.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Better,” he said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You think I’m clever, as you have stated. But you also worry that I get flustered too easily, and worry it will be used against you.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Do those records you’ve read talk about Paclo the Dusty?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Sure. He was one of your deputies before you met Wayne.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He was a good friend,” Waxillium said. “And a solid lawman. But I’ve <em>never</em> met a man who was as easy to startle as Paclo. A softly closed door could make him yelp.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She frowned.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I assume the records didn’t talk about that,” Waxillium said.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“They depict him as very brave.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“He <em>was</em> brave, Lady Marasi. You see, many people mistake startlement for cowardice. Yes, a gunshot would make Paclo jump. Then he’d run to see what had caused it. I once saw him stare down six men with guns trained on him, and he didn’t break a sweat.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">He turned to her. “You are inexperienced. So was I, once. So is every man. The measure of a person is not how much they have lived. It is not how easily they jump at a noise or how quick they are to show emotion. It’s in how they make use of what life has shown them.”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><a id="page_249"/>Her blush deepened. “I’m also thinking that you like to lecture.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“It comes with the lawman’s badge.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You don’t … wear that anymore.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“A man can take it off, Lady Marasi. But he can never stop wearing it.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">He met her gaze. She looked up with eyes that were deep, reflective, like the water of an unexpected spring in the Roughs. He steeled himself. He would be bad for her. Very bad. He’d thought the same of Lessie, and he had been right.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“There’s another thing I’m thinking about you,” she said softly. “Can you guess it?”</p>
<p class="bodytext"><em>All too well</em>.</p>
<p class="bodytext">With reluctance, he broke her gaze and looked at the pad. “Yes. You are thinking that I should talk Ranette into lending you a rifle. I agree. While I do think that it would be wise of you to train with a revolver eventually, I’d rather you spend this particular encounter with a weapon you use well. Maybe we can find a rifle that will fit those aluminum rounds Wayne grabbed.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Oh. Of course.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Waxillium pretended not to notice her embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I think,” Marasi said, “that I’ll go check on Wayne and Ranette.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Good idea. Hopefully she hasn’t discovered that he took one of her guns to trade.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">Marasi withdrew, walking to the door in haste.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Lady Marasi?” Waxillium called.</p>
<p class="bodytext">She hesitated at the door, turning, hopeful.</p>
<p class="bodytext">“You did a good job of reading me,” he said, nodding in respect. “Not many can do that. I’m not known to be free with my emotions.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Advanced interrogation techniques class,” she said. “And … uh, I’ve read your psychological profile.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I have a psychological profile?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Yes, I’m afraid. Doctor Murnbru wrote it after his visit to Weathering.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“That little rat Murnbru was a <em>psychologist</em>?” Waxillium said, <a id="page_250"/>genuinely baffled. “I was sure he was a gambling cheat, passing through town looking for marks to swindle.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“Er, yes. That’s in the profile. You, uh, have a tendency to think anyone who wears too much red is a chronic gambler.”</p>
<p class="bodytext">“I do?”</p>
<p class="bodytext">She nodded.</p>
