<p class="normal-t">I first pitched the idea of later-era Mistborn novels to my editor back in 2006, I believe. It had long been my plan for Scadrial, the planet these books take place upon. I wanted to move away from the idea of fantasy worlds as static places, where millennia would pass and technology would never change. The plan then was for a second epic trilogy set in an urban era, and a third trilogy set in a futuristic era—with Allomancy, Feruchemy, and Hemalurgy being the common threads that tied them together.</p>
<p class="bodytext">This book isn’t part of that second trilogy. It’s a side deviation, something exciting that grew quite unexpectedly out of my planning for where the world would go. The point of telling you all of this, however, is to explain that it would be impossible to list all of the people who have helped me along the years. Instead, the best I can do is list some of the wonderful people who helped me with this specific book.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Alpha readers included, as always, my agent, Joshua Bilmes, and my editor, Moshe Feder. This book is dedicated to Joshua, actually. Professionally, he’s believed in my work longer than anyone outside my writing group. He has been a wonderful resource and a good friend.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Other alphas were my writing group: Ethan Skarstedt, Dan Wells, Alan &amp; Jeanette Layton, Kaylynn ZoBell, Karen Ahlstrom, Ben &amp; Danielle Olsen, Jordan Sanderson (kind of), and Kathleen Dorsey. Finally, of course, there’s the Inseparable Peter Ahlstrom, my assistant and friend, who does all kinds of important things for my writing and doesn’t get nearly enough thanks for it.</p>
<p class="bodytext">At Tor Books, thanks go to Irene Gallo, Justin Golenbock, Terry <a id="page_8"/>McGarry, and many others I couldn’t possibly name—everyone from Tom Doherty to the sales force. Thank you all for your excellent work. Once again, I feel the need to give a special thanks to Paul Stevens, who goes above and beyond what I could reasonably expect to give aid and explanations.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Beta readers included Jeff Creer and Dominique Nolan. A special thanks to Dom for being a resource in regards to weaponry and guns. If you ever need anything shot properly, he’s the one to call.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Note the lovely cover by Chris McGrath, whom I asked for specifically because of his work on the Mistborn paperback covers. Both Ben McSweeney and Isaac Stewart returned to provide interior art for this book, as their work on <em>The Way of Kings</em> was just plain awesome. They’ve continued in their awesomeness. Ben also provided equally awesome illustrations for the recently released Mistborn RPG from Crafty Games. Check it out at <a href="http://crafty-games.com">crafty-games.com</a>, especially if you’re interested in Kelsier’s origin story.</p>
<p class="bodytext">Last of all I’d like to once again thank Emily, my wonderful wife, for her support, commentary, and love.</p>
