Shaken by a failed encounter with criminals, Coinshot Wax returns to his mansion, feeling his lawkeeper days are over. His butler, Tillaume, greets him with disapproval, subtly highlighting his neglected noble duties and the scandal caused by his absence.

Tillaume stresses House Ladrian's precarious state and the thousands depending on Wax. This forces Wax to confront his identity, realizing his Roughs life is childish and detrimental to his house.

Making a definitive choice, Wax places his mistcoat, revolvers, and shotgun into a trunk, instructing Tillaume to store them "for good." He sheds his old persona, accepting his destiny as Lord Waxillium Ladrian, prepared for his noble responsibilities.
