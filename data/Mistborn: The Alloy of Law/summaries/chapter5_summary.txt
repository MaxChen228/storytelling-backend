Wax descends from a skyscraper, using shotgun blasts and steel Pushes to land, damaging paving stones. He laments his lack of finesse, fearing he'll be seen as an uncultured brute compared to the Roughs. Distant gunfire sparks a thrill, reminding him of his patrolling days and purpose.

Following the sounds, Wax leaps across rooftops, discovering a shootout. Eager for "actual value," he drops into the fray. A whimpering sound triggers a paralyzing flashback to Lessie's death. He freezes, a thug's bullet grazing his coat. Appalled, he fires into the ground, Pushing himself out of the alley to escape.

Safe on a rooftop, Wax chastises himself for freezing, his first combat since Lessie. Constables subdue the thugs; Wax learns the "whimpering" came from a wounded gang member. Unseen, Wax retreats to Ladrian Mansion, still feeling like an outsider. His unresolved trauma and discomfort with his new life suggest his past will haunt him as he navigates the city's challenges.
