Waxillium Ladrian receives a letter from Elendel, a past he's eager to leave behind. His partner, Lessie, saves him from an ambush, their playful banter masking years of shared danger. Wax identifies the attacker as part of Donal's crew, a gang seeking revenge. Despite the added threat, Wax remains committed to his promise: finding Bloody Tan.

Splitting up, Lessie and Wax begin their search through the desolate town. Wax navigates a decaying hotel, eventually discovering a cold cellar entrance. Sensing smoke, he uses his Twinborn abilities to descend into unexpected depths, which feel more like a mine. He notes a movable ladder, suggesting the hideout is still active.

Deep within the dark tunnel, Wax flares his steel and detects metal. He cautiously approaches a flickering light, only to find a bizarre, ancient-looking corpse hanging there. He recognizes the deceased as Geormin, a local coachman, but the body's preserved state is unsettling. This strange discovery hints at a deeper mystery within the mine.
