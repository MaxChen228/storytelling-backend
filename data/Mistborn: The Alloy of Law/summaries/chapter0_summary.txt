Wax, a Steel-Allomancer, cautiously navigates the desolate town of Feltrel, hunting the psychopath Bloody Tan. He uses his ability to see metal as blue lines and maintains a defensive "steel bubble" around himself. Dressed in an incongruous fine suit, he moves stealthily, aware he's not alone. A sudden creak and gunshot confirm his suspicions. Wax instinctively Pushes against nearby nails, throwing himself to the ground as a bullet strikes where he stood. His steel bubble deflects a second shot, narrowly saving him.

He retaliates, firing a steel-jacketed bullet and Pushing it with extra force, hitting the unseen gunman on a hotel balcony. Another shot throws Wax to the ground, but he quickly realizes it wasn't aimed at him. A body tumbles from the blacksmith's roof, revealing a new development. His partner, Lessie, emerges, teasing him about his dusty appearance. They confirm the fallen man wasn't Bloody Tan, noting Tan's preference for personal, close-range kills.

Lessie's gaze falls on a letter peeking from Wax's pocket.
