Wax and Wayne face Miles and his Vanishers. Wayne notes Miles still has his lucky hat and more enemies are expected. Wax throws dynamite, and Wayne drops a speed bubble, deflecting it. Wax shoots the falling dynamite, causing a massive explosion. Miles emerges, and Wax lures him into a train car, trapping him in nets.

Miles, however, pulls hidden dynamite from his cigar case, detonating it to free himself. The powerful explosion hurls a dazed, injured Wax away. Miles, largely unharmed, delivers a monologue, proclaiming his divine purpose and the need for their powers to rule a corrupt world. He tries to sway Wax, who reminds him of his past murders.

Miles punches Wax, takes his gun, leaving him bleeding and dazed behind cover. Meanwhile, Wayne skillfully uses his speed bubbles and dueling canes to incapacitate multiple Vanishers. Miles's invincibility and grand ambitions now pose an even greater threat.
