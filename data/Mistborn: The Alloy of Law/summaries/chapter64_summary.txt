Waxillium, ducking gunfire, Pushes his special gun, Vindication, through a ceiling hole and follows, snatching it in the misty night. Marasi provides cover with aluminum bullets as two Allomancers—a Coinshot and a Lurcher—pursue him into the sky. Wax engages them in a perilous aerial battle around the Ironspine Building. He strategically uses a hazekiller round to launch the Coinshot away from the tower, isolating his opponents.

Wax then confronts the armored Lurcher, emptying his revolver, but the man's breastplate deflects the shots. As Wax drops, Marasi reappears, delivering a fatal aluminum shot to the Lurcher. Remembering the still-active Coinshot, Wax grabs Marasi and ducks back into the chaotic chamber below. Here, Wayne, a Slider, masterfully dodges a barrage of gunfire from a large group of Vanishers, drawing their attention with his speed bubbles.

Wax gives Marasi dynamite, instructing her to find cover and target the returning Coinshot. Wayne, sweating but grinning, confirms his fight with the powerful Pewterarm ended in a standstill, indicating that formidable foe is still at large.
