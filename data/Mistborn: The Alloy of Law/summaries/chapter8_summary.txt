Waxillium prepares for a crucial dinner with Lord Harms and his daughter, Steris, to solidify his noble life. He's shocked to find his old Roughs partner, Wayne, in his sitting room instead of them. Wayne, who should be watching Weathering, casually examines a clock, offering to trade it for whiskey.

Wax demands Wayne leave, fearing his reputation will be ruined, but Wayne refuses. He reveals he's investigating a missing food shipment, surprisingly suspecting Wax, linking it to his own losses to the "Vanishers." As Wayne questions him, Lord Harms, Steris, and a timid Marasi arrive, catching them mid-interrogation.

Without explanation, Wayne quickly dons a disguise, transforming into a gruff "Uncle Maksil," claiming to check on Wax's past. Charmed, Lord Harms finds common ground with "Maksil" on keeping Wax in line. Steris, however, remains observant, her eyes lingering on Wayne's discarded duster and hat. The stage is set for an awkward dinner, as Wayne's true intentions and Steris's keen observations promise further complications.
