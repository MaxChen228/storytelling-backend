Wayne, disguised as the frail old woman Abrigain, navigates a crowded railway station, using his persona to reach the front. He observes the Breaknaught, a formidable, vault-like train car with a massive door and welded cargo inside. A House Tekiel guard proudly details its impregnable defenses: six-inch steel, a door that locks for twelve hours, and eight armed guards within. Wayne, as Abrigain, subtly probes its resistance to explosives and Allomancers, his accent nearly slipping and raising the guard's suspicion.

Wayne creates a diversion with a blank shot from his cane, then uses a speed bubble to shed his disguise and re-emerge as a haughty nobleman. He confronts the pursuing guard, feigning outrage and accusing the "old woman" of being a Vanisher. He manipulates the guard, demanding more security for the train and concluding that even three dozen guards are "not enough."

Wayne's actions suggest a deeper plot is underway, and the train's supposed impregnability may soon be tested.
