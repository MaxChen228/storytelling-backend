Waxillium dines with Steris, Lord Harms, and Marasi, grappling with City life and his past as a lawman. He instinctively assesses the room for threats, a habit from the Roughs. Steris explains Marasi's university studies, but Wax finds her explanation too quick. A server with a distinct Terris accent approaches, and Wax immediately recognizes the disguised Wayne, who subtly slips him a wax-capped bullet casing.

Lord Harms and Steris lament recent kidnappings and robberies, including a relative of Harms, seeing them as an affront to City order. Marasi, however, shows keen interest in Wax's past in the lawless Roughs, even knowing details of his exploits. She then presents a surprising theory: the "savage" Roughs actually had double the lawmen per citizen compared to the City. This revelation suggests the City's crime problem is deeper than simple ruffians, hinting at systemic vulnerabilities or a more organized threat. Wax is intrigued by her unexpected insight and Wayne's sudden, disguised appearance. He anticipates that Wayne's presence means the investigation into the Vanishers is about to get much more personal.
