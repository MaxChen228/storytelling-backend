Waxillium detonates an explosion, clearing some Vanishers, but the open room is chaotic. He eliminates more enemies but is pinned down by aluminum bullets. He spots Miles, regenerating and armed, then confronts a Coinshot who deflects his shot. Tarson, a koloss-blooded Pewterarm, disarms Waxillium with incredible speed, leaving him overwhelmed.

Just as Waxillium is cornered, the roof above him explodes, and Wayne drops down, creating a speed bubble. Wayne, with a new duster and Marasi's help, quickly devises a plan. He engages the formidable Pewterarm, Waxillium the dangerous Coinshot, and Marasi provides crucial cover from above.

With the plan set, Wayne drops the speed bubble and charges the Pewterarm. The Coinshot's bullet harmlessly hits the ground. Waxillium lunges for Vindication, but the Coinshot instantly Pushes the weapon directly at his head.
