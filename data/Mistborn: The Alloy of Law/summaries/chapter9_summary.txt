Cautious Waxillium Ladrian and Wayne meet Lord Harms, his daughter Steris, and cousin Marasi, with Waxillium noting the room's exits. Steris immediately proposes a marriage alliance, explaining their families' plights: the Ladrian house is destitute and ill-reputed, while the wealthy Harms lack social standing and a male heir. She presents a detailed, multi-page contract, outlining courtship, conjugal encounters, mistress protocols, and her own potential dalliances.

Waxillium is uncomfortable with the contract's rigid, unromantic nature, questioning the absence of genuine affection. Steris, pragmatic, points to specific clauses for every contingency. As she probes Waxillium's religion, Wayne, handling a bullet, activates a speed bubble. Time freezes for the others, granting them a private moment. Wayne quickly dismisses Steris as "insane" and finds Marasi "cute," revealing his thoughts.

This sudden, private interlude suggests the path to this arranged marriage will be anything but straightforward, and perhaps more dangerous than it appears.
