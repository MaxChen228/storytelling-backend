Wax and Marasi are conversing when Wayne suddenly collapses, announcing the tea is poisoned. The butler, Tillaume, reveals himself as an assassin, leveling an aluminum pistol at Wax. Wax instinctively uses his steel Allomancy to Push a vest button, disarming Tillaume. As the dying butler activates a device in a basket, a massive ball of fire erupts, rapidly expanding. Despite his poisoning, Wayne creates a Feruchemical bubble, slowing the devastating explosion, but it continues to grow.

Realizing they cannot outrun the blast, Wax devises a desperate escape. He amplifies his weight using stored Feruchemical reserves, becoming incredibly heavy. This immense weight shatters the floor beneath them, dropping Wax and Marasi to the level below just as the full force of the explosion hits. They crash down, with Wayne landing on them, shielding them from the brunt of the blast. Dazed, Wax finds Wayne severely injured, his duster shredded and back blackened. Wayne had already depleted much of his stored health recovering from the poison, leaving his survival now critically uncertain.
