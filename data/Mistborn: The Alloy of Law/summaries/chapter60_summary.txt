Waxillium rides alone in the cargo car, disguised and armed with Vindication and dynamite, prepared to counter the robbery. He reflects on Harmony, expecting divine aid as the train slows and a thick mist forms, a detail Wayne notes will please him.

From a hillside, Marasi and Wayne observe the heist. A "phantom" railcar, a decoy, approaches the slowing train. Guards emerge, but the phantom reveals a rotary gun, unleashing rapid fire and screams. Wayne restrains Marasi from intervening, citing the danger and mist.

As Wax instructed, they watch the canal. A massive, dark machine—a barge with a crane—emerges from the mist. It stabilizes, then astonishingly lifts the entire vault car from the train onto its deck. The Vanishers' elaborate plan unfolds. After securing the vault car, the crane lifts something else large and rectangular from the barge.
