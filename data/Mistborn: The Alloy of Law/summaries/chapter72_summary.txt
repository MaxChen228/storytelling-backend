Injured and exhausted, Waxillium recovers in the precinct office. Marasi, deeply concerned, sits by his side, but Wax gently rebuffs her unspoken affections, burdened by his past and the emotional scars he carries. Constable-General Brettin, surprisingly calm, not only clears Wayne of impersonation but grants Wax a city-wide deputized forbearance, giving him powers of investigation and arrest. Brettin reveals he's retiring, and his successor will be bound by this mandate—a sudden, suspicious shift.

Wayne, ever the opportunist, covertly hands Wax a new gun, acquired by trading a dead man's scarf. While Steris is safe and gives her statement, the other kidnapped women remain missing, a failure Wax feels acutely. Steris approaches Wax, formally thanking him and awkwardly confirming she was not "touched indecently." Wax ponders Brettin's strange change of heart and the fate of the missing women.
