Waxillium discovers Miles is virtually unkillable, healing instantly from any wound thanks to thirty piercing metalminds. Wayne suggests removing them, but it's a daunting task. Marasi, a university student with basic medical training, steps in to stitch Wax's wound. She's flustered by the violence but notes Wax has seven old bullet scars, two more than official records, hinting at a hidden past and a life more dangerous than she knew.

Realizing Miles is still alive and now knows he's been exposed, the group understands he's more dangerous than ever. Wax suspects Miles will strike for aluminum soon, possibly tonight, targeting House Tekiel's new armored freight cars. They must move quickly and find a safe place to plan their next move, with Wayne subtly pushing for Ranette's.
