Wax descends into a dark tunnel, discovering Geormin's mummified, posed body. He realizes this is Bloody Tan's gruesome "gallery," passing more victims, each preserved and arranged in macabre tableaux, the last one recently killed. This chilling display confirms Tan's twisted artistry.

The tunnel opens into a ruined chapel where Tan's voice echoes, revealing his philosophy: life is a performance, and people are mere puppets. He boasts of creating this unique "show" for Wax, a true, unreproducible work of art. Tan then appears, holding Lessie hostage, gagged and wounded. Wax and Lessie share a silent understanding, a pre-arranged signal. As Wax fires, Tan yanks Lessie, and the bullet strikes her above the eye. Horrified, Wax watches her fall. Tan smiles, declaring this the ultimate, unreproducible performance. Enraged, Wax immediately shoots him in the head.

The echoes of the gunshots fade, leaving Wax alone with the devastating consequences of his choices.
