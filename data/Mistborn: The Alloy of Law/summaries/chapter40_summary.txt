Wayne leads Marasi to a dim, upper floor, where he pranks her by feigning death, then reveals more hidden explosives. They discover the dynamite was rigged to a chest and propped up by an expensive "Citizen Magistrates" cigar box. Inside the lid, scribbled numbers offer a potential clue, which Wayne believes Wax will use to develop a "grand theory" about their adversary.

Intrigued, Marasi asks Wayne about his mysterious past with Wax. He reveals he was a sixteen-year-old criminal, not very capable, who accidentally shot and killed an innocent, charitable bookkeeper—a father of three—during a robbery. Wayne, an Allomancer, was about to be hanged for his crime when Wax inexplicably saved his life. He still grapples with immense guilt, feeling he deserved to hang for taking a good man's life, and doesn't understand Wax's intervention. His haunted eyes reflect this unresolved burden.

The unique cigar box, now a crucial piece of evidence, awaits Wax's keen eye and unconventional investigative methods to unravel its secrets.
