Scadrial's world operates on three fundamental Metallic Arts, each manipulating Investiture through specific metals. Allomancy, the most common, is an end-positive art where practitioners burn metals as catalysts to draw external power, granting abilities like enhanced senses, physical strength, or emotional manipulation. This raw, instinctive power consumes the metal but channels energy from an external source, with sixteen base metals each offering unique effects.

Feruchemy, an end-neutral art, involves storing and retrieving personal attributes within metalminds. A Feruchemist might store health, strength, or memories, weakening themselves in the process, only to tap the metalmind later to regain or enhance those traits. Unlike Allomancy, the metal is not consumed, acting as a temporal conduit for internal power. This art is increasingly prevalent, though individuals often access only one specific ability.

Hemalurgy, largely unknown and often misunderstood as "evil," is an end-negative art that transfers abilities or attributes from one person to another, often with some power loss. Primarily concerned with spiritual aspects, its secrets are guarded by entities like the kandra, who serve Harmony. The narrator's keen interest in Hemalurgy suggests its profound Cosmere implications will soon become a central focus.
