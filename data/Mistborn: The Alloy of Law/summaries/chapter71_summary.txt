Severely wounded, Wax endures Miles's brutal beating and taunts. Miles claims Wax is a puppet of a corrupt system, questioning his heroism. Though in agony, Wax argues society has progressed, yet internally acknowledges the truth in Miles's accusation: he feels the frustration of injustice. Miles dismisses him as a tool, continuing the assault.

Marasi intervenes, confronting Miles, declaring he'll be brought down by something "lowly"—herself. As Miles laughs, Marasi drops her speed bubble, revealing Wayne and over a hundred constables. Miles, horrified, tries to escape but is overwhelmed and captured. Wax, injured, explains the plan: eliminate lackeys, then use the bubble to distract Miles for Wayne's forces.

Wax delivers a final lesson to Miles about isolation and reliance. With Miles captured, the city's deeper corruption and the mysterious "Suit" remain.
