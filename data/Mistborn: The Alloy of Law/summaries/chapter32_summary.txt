Disguised as a constable, Wayne interrogates a captured bandit, noting the prisoners fear talking more than the law. Wayne, feigning harshness, subtly switches to a street accent, revealing he's there to help the bandit escape. He gains trust, learning most won't talk, but new recruit Sindren might be a weak link. Wayne manipulates Constable Brettin into letting him choose Sindren for the next interrogation.

Wayne selects Sindren, a young, scared recruit. Alone, Wayne uses a speed bubble, an Allomantic ability, to speak privately despite Brettin's watchful eye. He claims "Clamps" sent him to facilitate an escape, building rapport by matching Sindren's dialect. Wayne learns Sindren was recruited recently and their base is the old foundry in Longard. Sindren also reveals most gang members seek money, but the boss is obsessed with "payback" and feels betrayed by the city, hinting at a deeper, personal motive.

Having gathered critical intelligence, Wayne now prepares to delve deeper into the gang's hierarchy and the boss's mysterious vendetta.
