As bandits begin their robbery, Wax uses Allomancy to discreetly hide Marasi's notebook and his dueling canes. He and Wayne feign fear, surrendering valuables, including Wax's marked bills for tracking. Marasi endures a humiliating pat-down, while Wayne, in disguise, loses his "lucky hat" to a gray-skinned bandit, Tarson. Wax's anger simmers.

The masked bandit leader, with an anxious associate, searches the room, comparing faces to drawings, seeking a specific hostage. His associate warns the men are "getting jumpy" and eager for violence. The leader first designates Steris, a relative of a previous abductee, then decides to take two, sending Tarson back into the crowd.

Tarson grabs Marasi, who drops her notebook. He discovers her detailed descriptions of the bandits, a dangerous revelation. With a pistol to her head, Tarson forces Marasi to come with them, leaving Wax staring down the barrel of another bandit's gun, Allomancy burning. Now, Wax must decide whether to unleash his powers or risk Marasi's fate.
