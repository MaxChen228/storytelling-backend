Wayne bursts into the Fourth Octant precinct, disguised as Captain Guffon Trenchant from the Seventh. Wearing a stolen uniform and fake mustache, he bellows for Captain Brettin, using a carefully crafted accent. Constables, confused and intimidated, point him to Brettin's office. Wayne, a master of stolen accents and manipulation, asserts his authority, claiming his precinct should have been informed about the captured Vanishers Gang members.

Brettin, annoyed, recognizes Wayne's "Captain Trenchant" persona and asserts his own jurisdiction. Wayne blusters, citing a "missed" missive and the Seventh Octant's prior claim to the gang's first robbery. He then proposes a deal: if Brettin allows him ten minutes with two prisoners, Wayne's precinct will drop all transfer requests, letting Brettin prosecute. This secures Brettin a career-boosting prosecution while Wayne pursues the elusive gang boss.

As they prepare the interrogation room, Wayne recognizes the first prisoner brought in: a man whose arm he broke with a dueling cane.
