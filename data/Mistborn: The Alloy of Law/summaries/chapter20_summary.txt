A wedding celebration is abruptly interrupted as dozens of city-dressed, well-armed bandits storm the ballroom. Waxillium counts over thirty-five men, some with Koloss blood, and notes their professional demeanor. Wayne prepares to fight, but Waxillium forbids it, prioritizing the safety of hundreds of innocent bystanders. Haunted by past violence and determined to prevent a bloodbath, Waxillium insists they observe and report, not provoke a firefight. Wayne reluctantly hides his dueling canes.

Marasi, meanwhile, frantically documents the criminals, citing statistics on witness unreliability despite her terror. The masked bandit leader, whose voice strikes Waxillium as familiar, demands all jewelry, promising no one will be hurt if they comply. Retired Constable Lord Peterus defiantly stands, proclaiming his identity and threatening justice. The leader brutally strikes Peterus, revealing a deeper motive: "payback" for what "city folk" have done to the Roughs.

Waxillium continues to observe the bandits' meticulous collection methods, all while the leader's familiar voice nags at him, hinting at a personal connection to the city's past.
