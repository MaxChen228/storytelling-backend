Waxillium, Marasi, and Wayne arrive at the Vanishers' hideout, an unassuming building by a canal. Wax, concerned for Marasi's safety, asks her to wait in the carriage. He and Wayne enter stealthily, with Wax Pushing Wayne onto the roof before following. Inside, they quickly disarm two explosive tripwires.

Marasi joins them in the unexpectedly empty, cavernous room. Wayne soon discovers a large, easily opened wall leading directly to the canal, which Wax realizes indicates frequent movement of goods. Marasi, employing her "deviation" theory, points out other clues: intentionally sooty windows and aluminum scraps Wax found, confirming the hideout's purpose for forging. They deduce the Vanishers are moving stolen freight car cargo via the canals.

Wax leaves to investigate outside, instructing Marasi and Wayne to search the sleeping quarters, humorously suggesting Wayne go first for any remaining traps. The duo now faces the task of exploring the potentially dangerous upper levels, while Wayne notes Wax is acting more like his old self.
