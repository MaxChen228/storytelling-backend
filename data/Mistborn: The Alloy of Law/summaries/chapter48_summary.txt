Miles and Waxillium draw their secondary guns simultaneously. Both fire, Wax taking a graze while his shot shatters Miles's kneecap and hand. Miles instantly regrows his wounds, but Wax shoots his dropped gun off the speeding train. Miles, unfazed, rises and confronts Wax, accusing him of being a "good hound" serving a flawed system. Wax counters, calling Miles a monster driven by wealth and Compounding.

Miles argues he serves a higher "alloy" of law and justice, targeting the powerful City criminals who exploit the Roughs, citing examples of their neglect. Wax rejects this justification for robbery and murder, but Miles believes Wax secretly understands his point. Miles then threatens Lady Harms and Wayne, before leaping away. Wax curses and gives chase, but Miles reveals an aluminum knife, making him immune to Wax's metal-based powers. He demonstrates his complete indifference to pain by stabbing himself.

The two circle, Wax realizing he cannot defeat Miles here, needing a more controlled environment and time to plan. Listeners can anticipate Wax's desperate search for a new strategy against his seemingly invincible foe.
