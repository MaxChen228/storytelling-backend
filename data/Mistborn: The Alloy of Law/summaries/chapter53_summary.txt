Ranette unveils her "Hazekiller rounds," specialized ammunition designed to counter different Allomancer types like Coinshots and Lurchers. Waxillium is impressed by her deadly ingenuity, but the rounds require a unique firearm. He reveals his urgent mission: rescue hostages, including Marasi’s cousin, who are being used to breed new Allomancers. Miles, their former colleague, is deeply involved in this sinister plot, prompting Ranette to understand the gravity of the situation.

Ranette then provides Wax with "Vindication," a custom, eight-chambered revolver with an Allomancer-only safety and hidden Hazekiller chambers. Designed by the missing gunsmith Nouxil, the gun contains a cryptic "call for help" translated by Marasi, confirming Miles uses Nouxil's advanced weaponry. Wax accepts Vindication, acknowledging its limitations against Blood-makers like Miles, but declares his personal duty to stop his rogue partner. He immediately tasks Wayne with acquiring shipping manifests and dynamite, and Marasi with buying strong fishing nets, preparing an unconventional "army" to face Miles's near-immortality.
