Wax struggles against the seemingly invulnerable Miles, who taunts him by revealing he's sent men to kill Steris. An injured Wayne arrives, confirming the threat and creating a speed bubble. With urgency mounting, Wax devises a plan: Wayne and Marasi will distract Miles while Wax uses Ranette's unique ceramic-tipped bullet. He launches the bullet, deflecting its casing but allowing the ceramic tip to strike the Coinshot in the eye, neutralizing the threat.

Energized, Wax charges into a hidden tunnel, which leads to a wooden building. He realizes it's a trap but pushes on, using his Allomancy to devastating effect. He Pushes on nails, rips apart floors, and propels himself through the structure, fighting through armed Vanishers with a storm of splinters and lead. He uses lampposts to maneuver outside, then crashes back in, clearing rooms with explosive force.

Wax's focus is singular: find Steris. He heads for the upper floors, ready for whatever lies ahead.
