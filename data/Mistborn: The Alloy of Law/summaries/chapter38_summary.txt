Marasi, Waxillium, and a napping Wayne ride a carriage through Elendel after fleeing a deadly attack. Marasi feels useless, regretting her emotional outbursts and longing to prove herself worthy of riding with the legendary lawman. She observes the city, still reeling from the recent violence, and tries to focus on the deeper mystery of the Vanishers' sophisticated operations.

Marasi questions Waxillium about his uncle's death, officially ruled a carriage accident. While he once dismissed it, Waxillium now suspects foul play, believing the "clean" reports were crafted to avoid his suspicion. He notes his cousin, the heir, had died weeks prior, and Tillaume was present. Wayne, waking briefly, interjects with a quip and then surprisingly reveals Ranette's address, catching Waxillium off guard.

Recognizing Marasi's lack of combat experience, Waxillium hands her a small pistol and begins instructing her on proper shooting technique, emphasizing steadiness and aim. He prepares her for the dangers ahead, hinting that she will need to defend herself.
