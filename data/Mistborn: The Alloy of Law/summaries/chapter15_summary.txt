Waxillium steps into a grand ballroom, overwhelmed by the opulent wedding's scale and cost, a stark contrast to the Roughs. Steris, in a fashionable red dress, explains the city's intricate social games. The guest list, she reveals, is a tool for calculated insults, where the Yomens deliberately exclude some while inviting nearly everyone else, ensuring the snubbed feel their isolation.

Steris details how even undesirable figures like Lord Shewrman are included to further slight the excluded. Wax finds this "nasty," preferring the Roughs' directness where rudeness leads to violence. Steris dismisses his "ignorant frontiersman" act as an unconscious masculine resistance to their marriage, asserting her pragmatism in navigating society's complex rules.

Despite his discomfort with the immense crowd and his lawman's instinct to watch exits, Wax maintains a civil facade. As the bride and groom arrive, he notices a scruffy man in black speaking with them, a strange sight amidst the grandeur. This mysterious figure suggests the evening holds more than just social maneuvering.
