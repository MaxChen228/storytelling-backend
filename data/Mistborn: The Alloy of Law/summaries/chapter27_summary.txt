Wayne gives Waxillium a revolver, but comically provides rifle rounds. Lord Harms, distraught, begs Wax to rescue his kidnapped daughter, Steris, revealing the Vanishers never release their victims. Wax, seeing Harms' genuine fear, promises to find her.

Marasi, sensing her uncle's preference for Steris's rescue, thanks Wax with a soft kiss, revealing her sharp shooting skills. Wayne obsesses over his lost lucky hat. Wax realizes the Vanishers are well-organized; the hat-thief likely has koloss blood, possibly a Pewterarm. He confirms Steris is not an Allomancer, leaving him puzzled by the Vanishers' motives.

Wax, exhausted, takes Wayne in, knowing he must unravel the mysteries surrounding Steris's abduction.
