Cornered by Vanishers, Waxillium uses Allomancy to fight his way through, Pushing spent casings and birdshot. Bullets chase him as he flees, crashing into a locked room where he finds a terrified Nouxil and a haggard Steris. With Vanishers closing in, Wax launches Nouxil out a window towards a canal. He then grabs Steris, propelling them through the ceiling and into the night.

Drawing on immense Feruchemical weight, Wax unleashes a colossal Push, collapsing the building into the railroad tunnel below, crushing most Vanishers. They land amidst the wreckage, Steris surprisingly exhilarated. From the misty tunnel, Miles's voice taunts Wax, challenging his purpose and calling him an army unto himself.

Wax hands Steris a shotgun, instructing her to run for safety, then reloads. He steps into the mist-filled tunnel, advancing cautiously. Suddenly, Miles throws torches, revealing himself holding a gun to Marasi's head.
