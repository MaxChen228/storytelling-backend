Five months after Lessie's death, Waxillium Ladrian feels suffocated by Elendel's lavish parties and social duties. He returned to save his insolvent House Ladrian, a duty requiring a wife. On a grand balcony, he reflects on his Roughs past, feeling out of place amidst the city's towering buildings and electric lights. He feels ancient and disconnected.

Unable to endure the stifling atmosphere, Wax dramatically leaps from the balcony, Steelpushing himself to the ground. In the coachmen's yard, he sheds formal attire for his mistcoat, re-holstering revolvers. This transformation signals his shift from reluctant nobleman to active lawman, abandoning the charade.

Equipped, Wax launches onto a nearby rooftop, leaving the party and its expectations. He considers seeking out Ranette, a skilled gunsmith with a complicated past, for better weapons. The misty night beckons, promising a return to the action he craves.
