Wax confronts Miles on the train roof, but Miles anticipates his moves, kicking Wax off the speeding train. Tumbling towards the ground, Wax instinctively Pushes on a knife, then sheds weight, using his Allomancy to propel himself back onto the tracks. He Pushes and Shoves on the rails, soaring through the air with exhilaration, quickly catching up to the train despite his fresh wound.

Wax lands on the train roof, finding Miles heading towards Wayne and Marasi. In a swift move, Wax throws a cartridge at Miles, then delivers a powerful Push through it, flinging Miles off the train and into the rocky terrain below. Injured but victorious, Wax rides the train to the next station. He learns the engineer couldn't stop due to the threat of the Vanishers, and realizes Miles had strategically trapped Wayne and Marasi before targeting him.

Wax, still bleeding, insists they must continue to the City immediately, fearing Miles will catch up quickly, possibly using a horse or his unknown Compounding stamina. Marasi and Wayne burst in, having escaped their confinement, expressing concern for Wax's injury. Wax, however, remains focused on the mission. The immediate danger is past, but the threat of Miles and the mysterious Vanishers looms as they press onward.
