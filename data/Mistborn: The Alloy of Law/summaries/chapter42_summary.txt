Miles puffs a cigar at his new, underground foundry hideout. His injured lieutenant, Tarson, reports Wax and Marasi were spotted at their old base, talking to beggars. Clamps suggests eliminating witnesses, but Miles refuses, fearing backlash and knowing Wax, "like a rat," would find them regardless. Clamps's traps were ineffective. Miles reflects on the strange, windowless facility, its electric furnaces and nascent underground railway orchestrated by Mister Suit. He draws on his goldmind for invigoration, but acknowledges his reliance on gold.

Recruitment is slow after losses, and rumors circulate that Miles and Wax are secretly working together, fueled by Miles's lawkeeper past. Miles, still carrying his old lawkeeper lighter, asserts his "true law" belief, claiming his men's work offers reform. He explains his fifteen years in the Roughs taught him individual effort is futile; true change must begin in the city's heart, invoking Trell. As Miles meets Mister Suit, his backer praises his carefulness and shared goals, hinting at a deeper, more manipulative agenda that will soon unfold.
