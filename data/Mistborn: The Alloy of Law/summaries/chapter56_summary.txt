Wax meticulously maps out Miles's likely target: a new, secure House Tekiel aluminum shipment at Carlo’s Bend. He deduces Miles will use a "phantom railcar"—a false front with a headlamp on a moving platform—to create a diversion during misty, canal-side attacks. Marasi arrives, confirming the constables have found the Vanishers' old hideout, meaning their window of opportunity is closing fast.

Marasi urges Wax to involve the constables, but he insists on his own plan, believing his deep understanding of Miles is their best advantage. He admits his arrogance but is convinced his method is the only way to catch Miles without scaring him off. Wax reveals he's prepared a letter for Ranette, detailing his findings for the constables should he fail.

Marasi, despite her legal training and worries for his safety, agrees to help. She correctly guesses Wax's thoughts about her usefulness and his concern. Wax assigns her and Wayne to watch from a hilltop, while he prepares to face Miles alone on the train.
