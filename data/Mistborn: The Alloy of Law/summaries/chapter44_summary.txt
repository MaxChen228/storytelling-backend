Waxillium confirms his grim suspicion: the Vanisher boss is Miles, a brutal former lawkeeper and powerful Twinborn. This revelation escalates the danger, making their private investigation far more perilous. Concerned for Marasi's safety, Waxillium tries to send her away, but she insists on staying, determined to gain experience and help. She reveals herself as a Pulser, an Allomancer who can slow time for herself. Though Marasi downplays its utility, Waxillium believes her ability could prove very useful.

As the train enters the Outer Estates, Waxillium grapples with the immense complexity. He feels overwhelmed, realizing Elendel's problems are far grander and messier than the Roughs. Despite Marasi's suggestion to involve constables, Waxillium remains committed to his promise to Lord Harms to retrieve Steris, feeling a deeper imperative to continue. He recognizes a disturbing similarity between himself and Miles, a thought that deeply unsettles him. The train slows, pulling into their station.
