Waxillium reflects on his time in the Roughs, realizing the City, which he once believed safe and protected by Harmony, might need him more. Marasi challenges his perception, noting the City's vulnerabilities and his vital work in Weathering.

Wayne returns, having served them as a waiter, and Marasi immediately recognizes him. Wax confronts her about her exaggerated timidity, and she admits her shyness is an act, orchestrated by Lord Harms, preferring not to elaborate. Wayne then effortlessly changes his attire using a speed bubble, impressing Marasi with his Allomantic skill.

Marasi, a university student, eventually reveals she studies legal justice and criminal behavioristics, feeling embarrassed because it's considered unfeminine, especially while sitting with two famous lawkeepers. Her hidden studies and connection to Lord Harms suggest a deeper involvement in the unfolding events.
