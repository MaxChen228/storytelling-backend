Pondering Allomancy's mysteries and the Law of Sixteen, Waxillium reveals a philosophical depth, seeing lawkeeping as a quest for answers. Marasi, intrigued, shares her motivation for studying law: a fascination with human nature's extremes—the "bright lights and dim places" of good and evil, seeking to understand deviation.

Wax then demystifies his legendary captures, admitting past motivations were pragmatic: money, boots, or a bet, not heroism. Marasi finds this compelling, yet confesses her preference for city life and traditional femininity, content to let men like Wax handle violence, not aspiring to be an action hero.

Despite her aversion to combat, Marasi asserts her desire to change the city, viewing traditional crime-fighting inefficient. She believes crime stems from environment, not individual choice, pulling out papers to illustrate her point. Listeners should anticipate Marasi revealing her alternative, research-based approach to improving the city.
