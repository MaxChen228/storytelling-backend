Waxillium confronts his uncle, Edwarn Ladrian, who reveals the true motive behind the robberies: an elaborate insurance fraud scheme designed to collapse House Tekiel and seize its assets. Edwarn admits to orchestrating everything, including Miles's capture, as part of his plan. Meanwhile, Miles faces a firing squad. Despite multiple volleys, he repeatedly heals from bullet wounds, revealing his Bloodmaker abilities and a hidden metalmind. With his final breaths, Miles rants about "men of gold and red" and "Trell."

Miles eventually succumbs to the relentless gunfire, his healing failing. As he dies, Marasi spots a mysterious robed figure watching from the shadows before disappearing. Waxillium realizes the kidnapped women are still unaccounted for, confirming a deeper, more sinister plot beyond the insurance fraud. He vows to stop his uncle, but Edwarn, surrounded by his own Allomancers, dismisses Waxillium, hinting at a grander destiny for his nephew and a powerful network of "colleagues."

Edwarn orders Waxillium thrown from the train, but Waxillium uses Allomancy to land safely, enraged but determined to return. Marasi, driven by an unshakeable curiosity, pursues the enigmatic figure into a dark alley, seeking answers.
