Marasi arrives nervously at Ladrian Mansion the morning after the wedding assault, clutching her handbag. Despite her admiration for Lord Waxillium, a living legend and her personal hero, she fears appearing a silly girl with a foolish hobby. Overcoming her indecision and nervous habits, she strides to the door. The long-faced butler, Tillaume, initially seems to disapprove of her visit but directs her to Waxillium’s study.

Marasi enters, finding the room surprisingly cluttered and Waxillium himself, wearing goggles, engrossed in scientific experiments. He is meticulously analyzing fragments of the mysterious guns used by the attackers. Wax explains that the weapons are made from an unknown, stronger aluminum alloy, and the bullets are yet another new material he needs to test. Marasi is struck by the contrast between the legendary lawman she imagined and the focused, somewhat eccentric scientist before her.

His intense investigation into these advanced, unknown alloys hints at a complex and dangerous new threat.
