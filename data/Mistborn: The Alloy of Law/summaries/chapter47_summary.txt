Waxillium bursts through doors, blocking Miles's shots to protect children. He launches onto the roof, determined to stop Miles. Miles appears, masked and armed. Wax clings to the car's side, then shoots Miles twice in the head. Miles rips off his mask, instantly healing, revealing a powerful, immortal Compounder with golden spikes.

Wax uses a bullet in a tree to propel himself between cars, but Miles charges him on the roof. Wax shoots Miles's gun hand, disarming him. Miles leaps, tackling Wax; they fall into the precarious space between cars. Miles slams Wax, shrugging off shots and punching him. Dazed, Wax tries to fly, but Miles hooks his foot, preventing escape.

Miles taunts Wax, confident his healing will outlast Wax. Desperate, Wax increases his weight tenfold, surprising Miles, who stumbles, unused to Feruchemical power. Miles retreats to the roof. Wax follows, steadying himself with his weight as they face each other across the swaying train. People flee. Wax hopes the chaos will draw Wayne.
