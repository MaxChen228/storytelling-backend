Waxillium crashes a harp, incapacitating two men, then scans the chaotic ballroom. Partygoers flee as he spots Wayne, shot and bleeding, a bandit standing over him. Marasi crawls up, concerned. Prioritizing Wayne over Steris—believing she's safe as a valuable captive—Waxillium shoves a pistol into Marasi's hand. He then leaps from the balcony, using his powers to tear through chandeliers and soar across the room, emptying his revolver into the bandit, who falls dead.

A speed bubble erupts as Waxillium reaches Wayne. Wayne, a Bloodmaker, reveals he played dead to avoid a headshot, healing his gut wound with limited healing remaining. He teases Waxillium about Steris, but Wax dismisses it, still grieving Lessie. They quickly assess the remaining bandits. With Wayne's bendalloy fading, they coordinate a final, powerful assault. Waxillium Pushes Wayne into the air, then launches himself, and together they swiftly eliminate the last of the attackers.

The immediate threat is neutralized, but Steris remains in the hands of the kidnappers.
