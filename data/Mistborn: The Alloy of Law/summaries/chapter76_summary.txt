Marasi pursues a figure, encountering the terrifying mythological Ironeyes. He calms her with emotional Allomancy, explaining Waxillium's friend has uncovered something dangerous. Ironeyes, who sometimes disagrees with Harmony, entrusts Marasi with a book for Wax, explaining he cannot deliver it himself as Wax would likely shoot him. He then departs.

Meanwhile, Waxillium lands at the rail station to find Wayne, arm in a sling. Wax confirms his uncle's involvement. Wayne observes the city is the true "rough part of the world," and Wax affirms his commitment to stay and finish the work. Wax then reveals he stole his uncle's pocket book, filled with notes, exchanging it for a threat and a promise. He feels a deep responsibility to clean up the mess his uncle created, driven by "Roughs honor."

These new clues promise to shed light on the dangerous secrets surrounding Wax's uncle.
