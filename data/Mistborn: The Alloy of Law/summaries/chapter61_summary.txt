Marasi watches the Vanishers expertly swap a replica railcar for the original, quickly loaded onto a barge. Shots prevent witnesses as the barge slips into the misty canal. Realizing Waxillium is trapped inside, Marasi urgently pulls a complaining Wayne into pursuit.

Miles, the mastermind, takes pride in his theatrical thefts aboard the "Machine" barge. He reveals to Tarson his crucial insight: Waxillium is inside the train car, having anticipated his opponent's move. Miles knows they cannot open the car here; it requires their specialized workshop. He dismisses dumping the car, valuing Suit's investment and desiring confrontation. Miles believes Suit underestimates Wax, but welcomes the clash, reflecting on his journey from lawkeeper to celebrated thief.

As the disguised barge glides through the misty canal into Elendel, carrying its valuable cargo and unexpected occupant, Miles anticipates the coming showdown. The workshop awaits, where Wax's fate will be decided.
