Waxillium struggles with his duty to marry Steris, haunted by Lessie's memory. Wayne challenges his new path, subtly pushing him back towards his old life by giving him a mysterious bullet. As their guests return, Waxillium hides the round, his mind already fixated on Wayne's provocation.

During the meeting, Steris reveals her cousin, Armal, was taken hostage from a playhouse robbery. Marasi identifies the "Vanishers" as responsible—a sophisticated group behind mysterious railway robberies, passenger car heists, and hostages. Waxillium's instincts stir, drawn by this ambitious criminal enterprise. He discovers Wayne's bullet is aluminum, a rare metal that nullifies Allomancy, a direct threat to people like him.

Despite Wayne's sarcastic jabs, Waxillium agrees to make his public debut with Steris at the Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner. This new threat, coupled with a personal connection, pulls Waxillium back towards his past.
