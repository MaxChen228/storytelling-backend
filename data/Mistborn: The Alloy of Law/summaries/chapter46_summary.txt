Wayne, ever the eccentric, explains his philosophy on lucky hats, even admitting his stolen one was a blessing in disguise to avoid an explosion. He then crudely attempts to play matchmaker between Marasi and Wax, while also discussing their opposing Allomantic powers. Marasi feels her time-slowing ability is pathetic compared to Wayne's, but together they investigate unusual, rectangular tracks by the canal, suggesting a large mechanical device was involved in a recent crime.

Meanwhile, Wax deduces that Miles, a former lawman, won't go to ground after his last heist. Instead, Miles needs one more quick heist for aluminum before he can truly hide and rearm, offering Wax a final opportunity to catch him. Wax's revised instincts prove correct when a bullet suddenly shatters the train window, narrowly missing him.

A masked figure, Miles, stands in the next car, confirming Wax's realization: Miles is not hiding, but actively hunting. The stage is now set for a direct confrontation between Wax and Miles.
