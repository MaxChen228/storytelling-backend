They arrive at Ranette's chaotic workshop, a space of strange machinery and snaking electrical cords. Ranette, a Lurcher, casually pulls tools with Allomancy, nearly hitting Marasi while working on a gun. She expresses disdain for Elendel and her past with Wax, who explains they need a safe place to strategize after his butler's assassination attempt.

Wax reveals they are hiding from Miles Dagouter, or Miles Hundredlives, who is actively trying to overthrow the city and has already attacked him. Ranette is unimpressed, yet the situation's gravity is clear. Wayne persistently taunts Ranette, who mostly ignores him, though Marasi senses a complex dynamic between them.

Marasi, feeling useless from her "unseemly" Allomancy and illegitimate birth, insists on helping. Wax, needing a new Sterrion after losing his to Miles, hopes Ranette will craft him one. The group lingers, needing to decide their next move against Miles.
