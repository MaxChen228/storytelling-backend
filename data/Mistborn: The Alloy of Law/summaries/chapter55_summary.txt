Miles, an Augur, relies on Feruchemy for near-invincibility, instantly healing from a twenty-foot fall. He observes his Vanisher crew, now better prepared with aluminum weapons, and notes the utility of two new Allomancer minders. Miles reflects on his temper, which often overrides his intentions, questioning his dedication despite believing he is "made by Trell." He notes the varying loyalty among his men.

Burning gold, Miles splits into two versions of himself: the rigid, angry lawkeeper and the cynical, slouching robber. Each despises the other; the lawkeeper loathes those who abandon order, while the robber sees law as arbitrary power. This internal battle leaves Miles weary, but he believes it helps him forge an "alloy" of his best selves. He sends his minders to check his men for hidden metal, asserting his authority.

Miles, who cannot be killed, decides to embrace his outlaw identity. He retrieves his old white duster, shedding his disguise and choosing to walk his chosen path with pride, refusing to turn back. Mister Suit's efforts to frame Wax are also noted. Meanwhile, Waxillium stares at the wall of Ranette’s sitting room.
