Miles walks with Suit through their new lair, discussing Wax. Miles respects Wax as a slippery, formidable rival, not a friend, believing their paths can only end with one of them dead. Suit, however, suspects Miles intentionally let Wax escape and views him as a liability, questioning his loyalty. Miles, driven by vengeance for his time in the Roughs and a desire to see Elendel's corrupt elite fall, remains internally conflicted, secretly aiming to use stolen resources for his own operations.

The Set, anxious and low on funds, plans to move Miles to a new railway station lair soon. Tonight, Miles must rob a train for aluminum, half for The Set, the rest for his men. Suit questions his effectiveness after the last mission and assigns two of his finest men to "aid" Miles, though Miles knows they are there to monitor him and ensure Wax is killed. The captured woman will serve as bait for Wax, whom Miles fully expects to interfere.

Miles grittingly accepts the interference, anticipating Wax's arrival at the target. He reflects on the changing world, with railways and electricity, seeing change as an opportunity. Tonight, Miles and his Vanishers prepare for a high-stakes train robbery, knowing Wax will be there to stop them.
