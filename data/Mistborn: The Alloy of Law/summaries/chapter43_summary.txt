Miles confronts Mister Suit, who blames his temper for the recent robbery's disaster and for provoking Waxillium. Miles defends his "Vanishers" persona as essential to baffle police and capture public attention, crucial for his goal to change the world. He denies a personal grudge against Wax, but declares he will fight and kill him if necessary, believing Wax chose the wrong side. Suit provides schematics for an "unrobbable" freight car, emphasizing Miles's role is execution.

Miles feels entangled in Suit's far-reaching plans. They discuss their captive, whom Suit regrets taking, knowing Wax will relentlessly pursue her. Suit suggests "more direct action" against Wax, but Miles asserts he will deal with Wax personally, today. Meanwhile, Waxillium reveals to Wayne and Marasi that Miles Dagouter is a Twinborn with "double gold" abilities, making him virtually immortal through Compounding—a process allowing near-infinite healing. Wax recounts their past as lawkeepers in the Roughs, noting Miles's harsh nature. Wax is now certain Miles is the masked leader of the Vanishers.
