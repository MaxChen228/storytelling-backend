Wayne, low on bendalloy and healing, struggles against a Pewterarm. He spots a bloodied Wax hurtling across the room, realizing his friend needs help. Dashing to assist, Wayne is shot in the arm, barely stemming the bleeding with his last metalmind. Identifying the shooter as a Coinshot with Marasi's rifle, he deduces her absence. Despite his injury, Wayne charges, determined to protect his friends.

Meanwhile, a severely injured Wax lies dazed, his guns lost and last pistol damaged. He engages a divine voice, Harmony, who explains his role in maintaining balance and empowering choice, revealing he "sent" Wax to act. As mist envelops him, Wax feels his pain lessen, then discovers his old trunk, filled with guns, directly in front. Empowered, Wax forces himself to stand.

Elsewhere, Marasi hides, disoriented by the chaos after disarming the Coinshot who now hunts her with her own rifle. She sees Wayne wounded and realizes she's unarmed and lost in the smoke and mist. Unable to reach the tunnel guarded by Vanishers, she is cornered as a mysterious figure emerges from the darkness nearby.
