Miles, rejecting the Church of the Survivor, guides his Vanishers through the mists. They transport a hidden train car, disguised as rock, via barge to the Ironspine. The car descends into a secret foundry hall. Miles is urgent, fearing Waxillium is close. He plans to open the car, deal with its occupant, and seize the aluminum. He notes a shortage of aluminum guns, losses attributed to Wax.

Miles believes Wax is inside, having deliberately lured him to this "den." He orders his men to arm with aluminum and fire immediately. Chains secure the car door to a powerful winch. Miles taps his metalmind, enhancing his abilities, though he acknowledges Wax's superior shooting. The winch groans, ripping the door free; it flies across the room.

As the door crashes, Miles spots a thin string leading into the car, attached to tape and dynamite. Someone inside pulls the string tight. Listeners should anticipate an explosive counter-attack from within the train car.
