Waxillium is horrified: Tarson, a koloss-blooded Pewterarm, holds Marasi hostage, not Miles. Miles issues a chilling ultimatum: Tarson will execute Marasi on the count of three. Haunted by past trauma, Wax activates a speed bubble for a daring plan. He fires one bullet, then Steelpushes a second to deflect the first precisely into Tarson’s head, instantly dropping him and saving Marasi.

Enraged, Miles raises his gun, but Wax disarms him with precise shots, then sends Wayne away to enact a "backup plan." Miles, a Gold Compounder, heals instantly and lunges at Marasi, forcing Wax into a desperate hand-to-hand fight. Wax's blows are useless against Miles's rapid healing.

Miles easily overpowers Wax, mocking his ideals and revealing a shared, unsettling understanding of their inner turmoil before kicking him down, injured and defeated. Listeners should anticipate the full, terrifying extent of Miles's power and the brutal continuation of their conflict.
