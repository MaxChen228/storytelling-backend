Marasi explains her "broken windows" theory to Waxillium, detailing how environmental improvements, like renovation, reduce crime more effectively than constables. Their discussion is interrupted by Wayne, who has located the Vanishers' hideout and their recruiter's name through his "whiskey and magic."

Waxillium realizes the Vanishers will have abandoned the hideout after recent captures, so they must investigate before alerting constables. Wayne confirms he's set a fuse for nightfall. Marasi insists on joining, arguing the danger is equal for all, especially since she was a target. She is determined to help rescue Steris.

As they prepare for the foundry, Waxillium questions why the Vanishers took Marasi, realizing she's not a primary bloodline target. He deduces she is Lord Harms's illegitimate daughter, Steris's half-sister. This revelation explains her connection to the kidnapping and adds a new layer to the mystery as they set off for the hideout.
