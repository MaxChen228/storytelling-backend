Waxillium battles the last bandit when Marasi, surprisingly skilled, shoots the man from the balcony, saving him. Wayne finishes his own assailants, impressed by Marasi's actions. Wax, remembering Steris, Steelpushes out, only to find her gone, along with the boss's body. He fears his theory about Miles might be correct. Constables arrive, led by Constable-General Brettin, who immediately scolds Wax for the chaos. However, Lieutenant Reddi reveals the true casualty count: 25 bandits dead, 6 captured, and only one civilian killed before Wax intervened. This vindicates Wax, but Brettin still asserts his authority, clashing with Wax over his vigilante methods. Wax defends his moral right to protect people, challenging Brettin's inaction. Brettin, frustrated, leaves without arresting the powerful House Lord.

Wax finds Marasi, Wayne, and Lord Harms. Wayne discreetly hands Wax an aluminum revolver, explaining he "snatched it" from the constables' collection and needs money for his expended bendalloy.
