Waxillium finds a faint pulse on Wayne, slowly healing Feruchemically. He comforts a dazed Marasi, checking her for injuries. Wayne, recovering, jokes about his ruined duster. To complete his healing, Waxillium rips off Wayne's burned skin, revealing new flesh, much to Marasi's horror.

The trio realizes the house is burning, and Tillaume has betrayed Waxillium, his attempted murder revealed. Wayne quickly suggests they fake their deaths to gain time. Waxillium, processing Tillaume's long-term deception, finds two unconscious staff members drugged and hidden by Tillaume, indicating selective targeting.

Waxillium moves the staff to safety and retrieves weapons. He understands Tillaume's betrayal isn't a spur-of-the-moment act but a long-term conspiracy. Tillaume had been trying to deter Waxillium from lawkeeping, confirming they've been watched. The missing house staff deepens the mystery as they must escape, leaving behind the assumption of their demise. This deception buys them time to uncover the plot.
