Waxillium Ladrian, a Coinshot, needs the mists. He expertly Pushes off metal, soaring across Elendel's modern cityscape, relishing the thrill. The vast city, with its electric lamps and horseless carriages, still astonishes him. He lands at the colossal, unfinished Ironspine Building, challenging his unique Twinborn abilities as a "Crasher" – a Coinshot who can also lighten his weight.

Ignoring caution, Wax drains his weight into metalminds and Pushes skyward, using a streetlamp as an anchor. When he drifts too far from the building's tiered structure, he fires his shotgun, the recoil propelling him back to the wall. He continues his ascent, grabbing protrusions and Pushing off steelwork, his movements precise despite the dizzying height.

Finally, Wax reaches the Ironspine's highest beam, the city lights spread below him like a vast, glowing map. The mists obscure much, but his knowledge of Elendel allows him to orient himself. He reflects on his time in the Roughs and his lost love, Lessie. From this vantage point, he prepares to make a crucial observation.
