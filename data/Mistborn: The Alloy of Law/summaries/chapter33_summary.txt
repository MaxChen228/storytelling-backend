Posing as one of them, Wayne tricks a naive youth into revealing the gang's foundry base and confirming key details, advising him to quit crime as he's unsuited for it.

Wayne then instructs the youth to talk to constables *after* Wayne clears the foundry, demanding freedom with a solicitor. He warns the boy to resist his upcoming "interrogation."

Wayne stages a loud, failed interrogation with Constable Brettin, feigning frustration before leaving. His dejection vanishes, revealing his successful manipulation. The youth's precarious future, caught between the gang and constables, now hinges on Wayne's next move.
