Wayne drops the speed bubble, and Waxillium immediately takes aim, prioritizing the safety of cowering bystanders. He uses a steel bubble to deflect bullets and quickly drops several shotgun-wielding bandits, preventing them from harming innocents. As the room erupts in chaos, Wax increases his weight a hundred-fold, then unleashes a powerful Steelpush, clearing the center of the hall of furniture and people, creating a temporary safe zone. Meanwhile, Wayne, grinning, rides an overturned table within a speed bubble, engaging bandits at the back of the room.

Bandits open fire, but Wax repels the barrage with a strong Push, revealing himself as a Coinshot. Realizing the danger, he lightens himself, launches into the air, and lands amidst the Vanishers, dispatching more men. Aware of his powers, the bandits call for aluminum bullets—a critical threat he cannot Push. Wax adapts, using increased weight to make bullets penetrate cover, taking down two more foes. He switches to a precise Terringul 27 as aluminum rounds fly, while Wayne continues his unpredictable dance, isolating and incapacitating bandits. With aluminum bullets now in play, the battle for the dining hall intensifies, pushing Wax and Wayne to their limits.
