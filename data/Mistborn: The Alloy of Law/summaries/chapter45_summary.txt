Wayne, Wax, and Marasi arrive at the Outer Estates, a railway robbery site. Wayne, eccentric, trades his cap and begins storing health, making him ill. Wax observes the tracks' proximity to the canal, a robbery pattern.

Marasi theorizes canal-transported machinery enables the swift robberies. Wax dismisses manpower or speed bubbles, explaining the impossibility of rapidly unloading heavy ingots from locked, guarded cars due to bottlenecks and immense bendalloy cost. He concludes unique "machinery" is responsible.

They begin searching for traces of this machinery. Wayne, bored, banters with Marasi about his hat. Marasi notes their sibling-like dynamic, observing Wax's changing accent and her efforts to impress him. The search for clues about this mysterious machinery continues, promising to reveal the Vanishers' true capabilities.
