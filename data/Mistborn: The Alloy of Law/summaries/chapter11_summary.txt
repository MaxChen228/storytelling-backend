The meeting with Steris and the Harms concludes, leaving Waxillium relieved but unsettled by Wayne's antics. Wayne reveals he acquired a bullet from the recent theater robbery, hinting at Waxillium's perceived eccentricity. Waxillium attempts to dismiss his past, but Wayne's observations about his hidden metalminds and gun catalog expose his internal conflict.

Wayne declares his intent to investigate the "Vanishers," a well-funded gang responsible for eight robberies and four kidnapped women. Despite Waxillium's protests, he provides a sharp analysis: the robberies are a distraction, likely targeting a specific, overlooked item, extortion, or blackmail related to the female hostages. He notes their vulnerability and the gang's calculated methods.

Wayne challenges Waxillium, asserting his true calling is to help people, a part he cannot abandon. He leaves to pursue the investigation, with or without his partner. Listeners can anticipate Waxillium's struggle with his new life as the mystery of the Vanishers deepens.
