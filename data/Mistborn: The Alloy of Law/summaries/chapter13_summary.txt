Determined to unravel the city's "senseless" crimes, Waxillium requests a large sheet of paper. Tillaume provides an artist's easel, stirring memories of his deceased sister, Telsin. Waxillium sketches the first reported theft: a wool shipment, a detail he finds illogical.

Consulting ledgers, Waxillium deduces the "wool" was actually **aluminum**, smuggled by Lord Tekiel. This explains the long delay: bandits likely used the aluminum to craft **aluminum bullets** for killing Allomancers.

Waxillium connects this to the kidnapped hostages—wealthy women secretly Allomancers. He theorizes the thieves, likely wearing aluminum-lined hats, target them. The robberies are about gathering these powerful individuals and Allomantic metals, not money. The "Vanishers" are systematically collecting Allomancers.
