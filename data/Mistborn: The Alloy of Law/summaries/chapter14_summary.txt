Waxillium is distracted from his ledgers by a diagram. His butler, Tillaume, reminds him of his duties to the thousands relying on his house. Tillaume recounts how his Uncle Edwarn, a successful gambler, saw the house suffer immense financial losses despite his winnings. He warns that even good things become destructive in excess, urging him to prioritize the vital.

Alone, Waxillium dons his Pathian earring for meditation, seeking Harmony’s guidance. Despite privilege, he feels bound by endless ledgers and social obligations. He questions if Harmony wants him to investigate the Vanishers or focus on lordly duties, preferring direct action. The Path's simple tenet—do more good than harm—leaves interpretation to his conscience.

A bullet from Wayne triggers a horrifying flashback of Lessie’s death, her blood, and the chilling realization the murderer wasn't the shooter. Overwhelmed, Waxillium vows, "I can't do that again." He rationalizes the Vanishers have only robbed, not harmed, and likely won't endanger hostages. He puts away his investigative tools, removes his earring, and forces himself to focus on house ledgers, working late. Yet, the city's escalating unrest and his unresolved past hint that his focus on ledgers may not last.
