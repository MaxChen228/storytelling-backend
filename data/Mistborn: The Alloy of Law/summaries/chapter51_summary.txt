Wax, Wayne, and Marasi arrive at Ranette's townhome. A lean, Roughs-attired Ranette slams the door, then reopens it with a shotgun. She counts to ten, threatening to shoot if they don't leave. Wax and Wayne quickly retreat, Marasi confused by their friend's aggressive welcome. Wax explains Ranette's brusque nature; Wayne jokes her shooting him is affection.

Despite the danger, Wax insists they need Ranette's help for innocent lives. Wayne offers Ranette a unique aluminum revolver as a bribe. A Lurcher, Ranette recognizes the metal's value and hesitates. Wax reluctantly hands over the valuable weapon, from the notorious Vanishers whom Ranette surprisingly doesn't know. Intrigued, Ranette finally agrees to let them in, warning Wayne against touching anything.

Inside, Marasi observes Ranette's home: locks twist, doors open automatically. Marasi realizes Ranette is an Allomancer, controlling her environment, explaining her aluminum recognition and reclusive lifestyle. As they step further into her secured home, Ranette's unique skills and the danger they face will become clearer.
