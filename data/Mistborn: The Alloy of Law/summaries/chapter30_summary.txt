Waxillium and Marasi deduce that common criminals, the Vanishers, are backed by a mysterious financier. The expensive weapons and the discrepancy in stolen goods versus their cost reveal the robberies are merely a cover. The backer uses the bandits to kidnap specific women, while the bandits keep the loot, likely unaware of the true agenda. Marasi worries that despite their efforts, the well-funded operation will not cease.

Wax spent the night meticulously tracing the genealogies of the kidnapped women. He discovers a pattern: all the women have strong Allomantic bloodlines, converging on the legendary Lord Mistborn. Initially, Wax believes the backer seeks to recruit Allomancers, but Marasi makes a chilling realization. The kidnappers aren't building an army; they are breeding one, targeting women with direct Allomantic heritage to create a new generation of powerful individuals.

This revelation means Steris, not an Allomancer, faces a different kind of danger – either as a mistake or for her connections. Wax is subdued by the implications, realizing the true horror of the plan. Wayne, meanwhile, is out on a mission of "mischief," his whereabouts unknown.
