Wayne, disguised as a nobleman, berates a guard captain for leaving his post after a creature attack. Swiftly, he sheds his persona, using speed bubbles to transform into "Farnsward Dubs," a Tekiel guard. He introduces "Bren" (Wax, also disguised) to the frazzled captain, claiming they are Lord Evenstrom's men. Wax emphasizes the train *must* depart, despite the panic.

Gunshots erupt; Wax dramatically falls, seemingly wounded. Wayne, acting frantic, shoves him into the Breaknaught's cargo car, then slams and locks the door, trapping Wax inside. He quickly convinces the bewildered captain and noblemen that this action secured the valuable cargo from the "attackers," a staged event with blanks. The captain, eager to claim victory, accepts Wayne's narrative.

With the "robbery" thwarted, the train departs. Wayne deflects praise, letting the captain take credit, and slips away as House Tekiel celebrates their perceived triumph. The Breaknaught is now underway, carrying Wax and its mysterious contents.
