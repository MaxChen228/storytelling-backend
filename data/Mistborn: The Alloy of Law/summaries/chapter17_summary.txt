Marasi captivates Waxillium with her insightful analysis, arguing that the city, despite its reputation, is more dangerous than the Roughs due to hidden crimes and concentrated wealth. Waxillium finds her perspective refreshing, a stark contrast to the usual city chatter. As Wayne serves soup, he secretly passes Waxillium a rolled note inside a wax-sealed shell casing. Waxillium reads the cryptic message: "You were right."

Dinner conversation devolves as Steris attempts to steer topics towards polite society. Waxillium, however, delights in recounting tales of shooting a dog's tail (aiming for its balls) and throwing a knife (also aiming for balls, but hitting an eye by accident). Steris is mortified and retreats, while Marasi and Lord Harms find Waxillium's candor amusing. Harms reveals Steris's mother was similar, then excuses himself to avoid her return.

Waxillium feels a pang of guilt for provoking Steris, but finds her hard to resist. Marasi thanks him for defending her and presses him on the dog story, which he clarifies was a defensive, non-lethal shot. She then asks about his crestfallen look regarding lawman statistics.
