Bandits terrorize the ballroom, shoving Steris towards an exit. Waxillium, haunted by past mistakes, hesitates. Lord Peterus bravely offers himself as a hostage, but the bandit leader swiftly silences him with a fatal gunshot.

Enraged, Wayne activates a Bendalloy bubble, freezing time. He reminds Waxillium some fights are unavoidable, and shame gives way to cold resolve. Retrieving two hidden pistols and consuming steel, he sheds hesitation, ready to fight.

With time frozen, they plan: Waxillium rescues the girls; Wayne handles the south side, prioritizing bystander safety. Wayne reveals he sought Waxillium to save him from boredom. Fully committed, Waxillium cocks pistols. The frozen ballroom is about to erupt.
