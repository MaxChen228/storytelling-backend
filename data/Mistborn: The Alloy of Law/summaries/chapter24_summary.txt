Waxillium drops his protective bubble, useless against the bandits' aluminum bullets, as gunfire echoes through the hall. He spots the masked bandit boss in the doorway, whose imperious stance and locked gaze make Wax wonder if it's Miles. Suddenly, Marasi screams. The koloss-blooded Tarson, wearing Wayne's hat, seizes her, pressing an aluminum gun to her head. Wax is paralyzed by a past trauma, reliving Lessie's death, unable to fire.

Marasi, knowing they won't kill her, bravely headbutts Tarson, causing his shot to go wild. Wax's mind clears; he shoots Tarson in the arm and then fires his last bullet, hitting the masked leader in the head, seemingly disproving his Miles theory. Grabbing Marasi, Wax uses his Steelpushing to launch them into the air, dodging a hail of bullets, and lands them on a nearby balcony. Marasi, shaken but brave, thanks him.

Just as they catch their breath, more Vanishers burst onto the balcony, forcing Wax to desperately push a harp into their path.
