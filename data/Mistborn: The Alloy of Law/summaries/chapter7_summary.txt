Six months into his new role, Lord Waxillium Ladrian meticulously adjusts his cravat, a lawman habit earning respect and allowing him to be underestimated. He feels out of place in his ancestral mansion, preferring his lawman past to his lordly present. Today’s dreaded meeting with Lord Harms and his daughter is a crucial step to save House Ladrian from ruin, a duty to atone for past neglect. As guests arrive, Wax stalls, seeking distractions from house steward Miss Grimes, who reminds him of his mother’s hopes for his marriage. She reveals another steel shipment stolen by the "Vanishers," targeting his house. Wax feels the familiar pull to investigate, his hand instinctively reaching for his sidearm, but sternly reminds himself he is a lord, not a lawman.

Miss Grimes anticipates his public appearance with Miss Harms, despite Wax’s protests that nothing is decided. A sealed letter arrives, which Miss Grimes speculates is a wedding dinner invitation, perfect for their debut. She confidently predicts the match will go well, still treating the 42-year-old as her "young master." As Wax faces his social obligations, the mystery of the Vanishers looms, threatening to pull him back into his old life.
