Waxillium stands in his mansion, feeling restless without the mists. Though he tries to focus on his new life, the mention of the Vanishers reignites his detective instincts. Unable to resist, he gathers broadsheets to investigate the mysterious crime spree.

He discovers the first robbery occurred seven months ago, before his arrival, targeting Augustin Tekiel's cargo. A four-month gap preceded the second, when the "Vanishers" name emerged. The heists involve trains stopping due to distractions, followed by the impossible emptying of secured cars, leading to theories of mystical powers. Later thefts include steel, foodstuffs, and passenger abductions, with increasing security failing to stop the quick, efficient operations. Wax notes Tekiel's delayed public complaint about the first theft.

Frustrated by the broadsheets' lack of specific details, especially regarding Tekiel's initial stolen shipment, Wax cuts out articles. His butler, Tillaume, observes Wax slipping back into old investigative habits. Wax is determined to uncover what was in that first, pivotal cargo.
