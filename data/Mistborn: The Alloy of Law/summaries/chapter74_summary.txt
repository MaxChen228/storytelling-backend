Marasi attends Miles's execution, recalling his chilling gaze and her first kill. Miles, contemptuous and convinced of immortality, faces the rifles. As shots fire, Marasi feels a profound satisfaction that deeply disturbs her.

Meanwhile, an injured Waxillium boards a train, tracking his Uncle Edwarn Ladrian, who faked death. Wax confronts Edwarn, having deduced his location from Miles's hidden train routes. Edwarn admits Wax's sister, Telsin, is alive, but confesses he brought Wax back for the house title, hoping he'd be a "resource" after his butler's failed assassination.

Wax demands the four kidnapped women and Telsin. Edwarn, amused, denies involvement, claiming Miles acted independently and dismissing Wax's threats, confident his "colleagues" remain untouched. Wax insists Edwarn is ruined, despite claims of solvency. The true extent of Edwarn's network and the fate of the missing women remain uncertain.
