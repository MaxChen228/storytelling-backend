Miles Hundredlives, calm and powerful, counts bullets as a Coinshot reports Pull's death and struggles to catch Wayne. Miles advises drawing out Wax and Wayne like "rats," noting Waxillium is wounded and unarmed.

Miles then turns his revolver on Marasi's hiding place, demanding she scream for Wax. Marasi freezes in terror, unable to move. Suddenly, Waxillium emerges from the mist, fully armed and smiling, despite Miles's earlier claim. He immediately blasts Miles with a shotgun. The confrontation has just begun.
