Waxillium Ladrian, looking younger despite his exhaustion, marvels at the city's convenience for his lab work, testing gunpowder. Marasi questions their being alone, citing propriety, but Wax dismisses it as "nonsense," arguing it stems from distrust. He reveals he's analyzing the stolen aluminum, suspecting an alloy with a traceable component like ekaboron, musing on how alloys create new substances, akin to Allomancy and human change.

Marasi offers crucial financial backing from Lord Harms for Steris's rescue, relieving Wax, whose household lacks liquid assets. She notes his profound fatigue, urging rest, but Wax is consumed by guilt, feeling he failed to act. He insists on being productive.

Wax concludes the kidnappers were experienced thieves but not "professionals," evidenced by their unrefined, violent behavior. Marasi agrees, noting their impulsiveness. This distinction is key to understanding their methods. The next step involves leveraging this insight to track down Steris.
