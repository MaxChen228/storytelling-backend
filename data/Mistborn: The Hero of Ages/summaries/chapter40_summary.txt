Vin, still wary of Cett's true intentions, follows his instructions to a specific mansion. There, she finds the informant, an old man nicknamed Slowswift, calmly reading on a lit balcony, completely unfazed by her Mistborn arrival. He seems more interested in discussing "Longtales" and ancient myths than providing immediate information, casually revealing Cett as an old "writing friend" and poet. Vin, pragmatic and focused, presses him for details on Yomen, the obligator king.

Slowswift surprisingly praises Yomen as a good and decent ruler who brought much-needed stability to Fadrex City after the Collapse. He explains that Yomen achieved this by restoring familiar structures like plantations, factories, and even nobility balls, giving both skaa and nobles a crucial sense of order and identity. Slowswift highlights Yomen's clever strategy of maintaining normalcy, even throwing a grand ball tonight despite an army besieging the city, which Yomen personally attends to reassure his people.

When Vin finally asks for Yomen's weaknesses, Slowswift firmly refuses, stating his admiration for the king and his unwillingness to betray someone he likes. A grand ball, personally attended by Yomen, takes place tonight at Keep Orielle.
