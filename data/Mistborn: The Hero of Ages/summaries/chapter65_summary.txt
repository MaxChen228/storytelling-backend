TenSoon faces judgment from the Kandra First and Second Generations, enduring their disdain. He feels triumph in the dog body Vin gave him, a form he finds natural. Defiantly, he declares he is there to give information, not to be judged, directly challenging KanPaar and the First Generation.

TenSoon passionately warns the First Generation of the world's impending doom—mists, ash, and quakes—urging them to act and accept the Resolution. The First Generation, detached, instructs KanPaar to proceed, who delivers a brutal sentence: ritual imprisonment, beating, bricking into a pit for ten generations, then execution.

As guards raise hammers, TenSoon reveals his secret: dogs are built for speed. Using the powerful wolfhound body, honed by Vin's training, he leaps across the room, crashing into KanPaar, shattering his crystal bones. He expertly navigates the chaos, leaping over the stunned kandra crowd and fleeing the Trustwarren, abandoning his home and honor.

Now a fugitive, TenSoon races into the unknown, his desperate flight marking a perilous new journey.
