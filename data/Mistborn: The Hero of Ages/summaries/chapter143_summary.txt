Ruin manipulates pawns like Yomen to investigate atium caches, fearing deception after his spiking attempt failed. Spook awakens in Urteau, severely injured, after a dream where Kelsier urges a crucial message. Breeze and Beldre care for him, but Sazed has already departed south with Vin’s kandra. Though the city is mostly safe, ash falls thicker, and refugees flood in.

Despite his pain, Spook realizes he was controlled by the entity Vin released—Ruin—which attempted to seize Urteau. He must warn Vin. Captain Goradel, grateful to Vin for saving his life, volunteers to deliver the message. Unable to speak, Spook instructs Goradel to prepare a thin metal sheet and tool to scratch the critical message into steel.
