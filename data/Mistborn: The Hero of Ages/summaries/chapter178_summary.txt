The kandra are revealed as Preservation's double agents, created by the Lord Ruler as Ruin's betrayers. Elend surveys a massive, Terrisman-organized refugee camp, critically low on food and lacking defenses, regretting his departure from Luthadel.

Demoux reports Luthadel fell to a house war, Penrod's madness a Ruin-manipulated tactic. Kelsier mysteriously appeared, instructing soldiers to lead people out, saving many; Elend asks to meet them.

Elend then instructs Demoux to give his soldiers Allomantic metals, revealing they are now Allomancers—a new force. A massive koloss army, driven from Fadrex, now approaches the vulnerable camp.
