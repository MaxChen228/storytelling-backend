Atium is pure Ruin's power, hidden by Preservation. Imprisoned by the Second Generation kandra, Sazed reflects on the world's end and his growing faith in Vin as the Hero. Stripped of his metalminds, he begins storing weight and speed into his iron grate and steel lock, determined to escape and help Vin, the world's preserver.

TenSoon, in his wolfhound body, arrives with MeLaan and other kandra to free him. Sazed reveals the shocking truth: the Second Generation has imprisoned the Firsts, seizing control. MeLaan is horrified, but other kandra express rebellious sentiments against the Seconds' rule, seeing TenSoon as a revolutionary for defying their insistence on serving humans.

Their conversation is cut short as Fifth Generation kandra attack. TenSoon, a skilled fighter, charges forward, using his wolfhound body effectively, though outnumbered. Sazed observes TenSoon's rapid healing and the kandra's vulnerability to blunt force, positioning himself to use his stored Feruchemical power. The kandra civil war has begun, and Sazed is now at the heart of it.
