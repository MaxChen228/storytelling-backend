Vin battles Inquisitors, fueled by a furious mist-storm emanating directly from her, brutally dispatching foes and pulling eye-spikes as her Allomancy reaches an unprecedented level.

She confronts a broken Marsh, recognizing him as Ruin's vessel. The mists fully absorb into Vin, revealing a vast, unknown power as she realizes she has laid a trap for a greater foe.

Marsh, enduring agonizing pain, feels relief that his defiance against Ruin succeeded. As Vin begins to pull his eye-spikes, she hesitates, then suddenly vanishes, leaving only a dissipating misty outline. Listeners should anticipate where Vin has gone and the immediate aftermath of her disappearance.
