The world teeters on the brink as relentless ashfall smothers all plant life, overwhelming the Lord Ruler's microbes. TenSoon, disguised as a wolfhound, returns to a Luthadel he barely recognizes. The city is horrifically overcrowded, reeking of filth, and its skaa inhabitants are sick and starving. He feels a stab of anxiety for Vin and Elend, fearing the city's dire state signals their defeat.

At Keep Venture, TenSoon eavesdrops on guards who speak of "King Penrod" holding the emperor's authority, hinting at political upheaval. They also make a puzzling claim about being "safe from the mists." Frustrated by the lack of clear answers and convinced the world is ending, TenSoon resolves to act. He recalls the agonizing secrets he extracted from his kandra brother, OreSeur, whom he tortured and killed for information.

Following OreSeur's dying instructions, TenSoon makes his way to the Church of the Survivor warehouse. There, he begins to dig, unearthing the very bones of Kelsier, the legendary Survivor, which OreSeur had buried years ago after impersonating him. TenSoon, despite his deep-seated hatred for humans, now plans to use these old bones and his kandra abilities to become Kelsier himself. Listeners can anticipate the dramatic consequences of TenSoon's audacious impersonation.
