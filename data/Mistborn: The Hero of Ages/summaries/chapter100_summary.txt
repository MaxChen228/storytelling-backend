Ruin remains imprisoned by a cosmic balance, rendering him largely impotent despite his release from the Well. Stripped of his true body, he yearns to destroy the world and is obsessed with finding the hidden part of himself to regain full power. Meanwhile, Elend stands in the mists, consumed by worry for Vin, who was captured three days ago. He feels inadequate, unable to act with Vin's brash determination, and struggles with the conflict between rescuing her and his duty to his army. Paradoxically, he finds comfort in the mists, despite Vin's growing distrust of them.

Cett arrives, bluntly stating his belief that Vin is as good as dead, but acknowledges Elend's unique ability to inspire loyalty in his soldiers, even as their morale falters. The siege on Fadrex City is failing; supplies dwindle, and Luthadel is in revolt. Cett urges Elend to abandon the siege for a direct attack on Fadrex to secure supplies, then retreat to Luthadel. As Elend contemplates this, he hears another fight erupt among his restless men, with General Demoux intervening.

The mounting pressure from his army's dwindling supplies and growing unrest forces Elend to confront the harsh realities of his leadership and the desperate choices ahead.
