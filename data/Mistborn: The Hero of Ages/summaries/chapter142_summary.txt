Marsh confronts Vin, dismissing her "idealism" about Elend. He insists Elend, like everyone, belongs to Ruin, destined to embrace destruction. Vin rejects this, but Marsh presses, asking if Elend would attack the city for her, just as Vin once killed for him, reminding her of her violent past.

Vin grapples with memories of her brutal assault on Cett's tower, acknowledging the strategic sense of Elend attacking. She reflects on her own past violence and Elend's character.

Ultimately, Vin declares Elend won't attack, believing he is a better person than she is. The city's fate now rests on Elend's moral compass.
