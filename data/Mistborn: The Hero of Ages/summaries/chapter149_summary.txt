Sazed rides TenSoon, who has transformed into an enormous, super-strong horse by ingesting a hog and a real horse. Ash covers the land, making travel difficult, but TenSoon's enhanced form allows relentless speed. Sazed feels shame for his past inaction but finds renewed hope in the Terris religion, believing it holds the truth about the Hero of Ages. He realizes he must interrogate the First Generation kandra.

TenSoon explains that kandra are mistwraiths awakened by two metal spikes, called Blessings, which grant them endurance and more independence than the heavily spiked Inquisitors or koloss, who are more susceptible to Ruin's impulses. He reveals the Hero of Ages will lead an army of Allomancers to the kandra Homeland to save everyone. Sazed's task is to convince the First Generation kandra of the dire situation and prepare them for a difficult, necessary action.

They arrive at the kandra Homeland, a cavern complex hidden near the Pits of Hathsin. TenSoon departs, leaving Sazed to dig his way into a hidden tunnel. Sazed now faces the challenge of confronting the kandra elders and uncovering ancient truths.
