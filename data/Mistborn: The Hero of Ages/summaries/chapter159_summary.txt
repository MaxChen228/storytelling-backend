The Lord Ruler secretly knew of all sixteen metals, withholding some to maintain an advantage or deeming humanity unprepared. This secrecy inadvertently aided Vin later, as Ruin struggled to arm his Inquisitors with duralumin. Now, Vin arrives at a devastated Luthadel, a cold rain falling as she senses a dozen Mistborn Inquisitors pursuing her. She lands at Kredik Shaw, the Lord Ruler's abandoned palace, her mistcloak a nostalgic comfort. Ruin appears, initially believing Vin holds the atium, but quickly realizes she has led him into a trap. Enraged by her defiance, he vanishes, and a horde of Inquisitors, including a heavily spiked Marsh, descends upon her.

Vin fights fiercely, using duralumin to push back her attackers. She rips a spike from one Inquisitor's eye, but it surprisingly survives, revealing a new, terrifying resilience. She quickly discerns that these Inquisitors possess more spikes than usual, granting them Feruchemical-like powers of strength and speed, making them akin to miniature Lord Rulers. As she struggles, bleeding and using her last metal vial, Vin understands the true extent of Ruin's enhanced forces.

The battle has just begun, and Vin faces a far more powerful and dangerous enemy than she anticipated.
