Quellion delivers a public speech, projecting benevolence while secretly planning to denounce Spook and attack his Ministry base. Spook and his allies attend, anticipating Quellion's move and relocating their forces. Durn, the underground leader, warns Spook of city unrest and Quellion's intentions. As Quellion speaks, Spook hears distant, uncontrolled riots, signaling rapid chaos. Kelsier's voice whispers, comparing this night to his own revolution. Durn's men create a diversion, drawing guards away.

Spook, flaring pewter, sheds his disguise and leaps onto the stage, revealing himself as a powerful Allomancer. His goal: expose Quellion's hypocrisy, forcing him to use his powers to destroy his rule, while Breeze and Allrianne captivate the crowd. Spook confronts Quellion's guards, facing a formidable pewter-burning Thug. He disarms the Thug with a lie, then, prompted by Kelsier's voice, delivers a fatal blow, shattering his cane and seizing the Thug's obsidian cudgel. The city burns as Spook pursues Quellion across the stage, ready to expose his deceit and claim the city.
