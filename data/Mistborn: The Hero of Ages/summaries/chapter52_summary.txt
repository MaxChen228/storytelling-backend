Vin and Elend make a dramatic, uninvited entrance at a Fadrex City ball, immediately drawing King Aradan Yomen's attention. Yomen, a young obligator, appears dumbfounded and subtly dismisses his guards, creating a ripple of chatter. Elend explains their strategy: they must mingle and split up to shatter the city's sense of security before he confronts Yomen. He tasks Vin with finding potential allies among the dissatisfied nobility.

Vin feels a brief unease in her gown but quickly focuses. She spots the most imperious noblewoman and boldly approaches, sitting uninvited. Vin directly accuses the woman of planning to abandon her allies when the army attacks, offering protection to her sycophants. The indignant lady denies it, but Vin calmly asserts she knows her type wouldn't let Yomen determine her future. Vin sips her wine, noting she hasn't even begun to threaten her, signaling her intent to disrupt the city's power structure and seek out new allies.
