Ruin exploits unstable personalities, enhancing existing impulses. Quellion, already prone to paranoia, placed his own bronze spike, becoming a Seeker and a tool for Ruin. This susceptibility to Ruin's influence, even without a spike, explains how figures like Zane were likely manipulated.

Outside Fadrex, the koloss army grows, forcing an uneasy alliance between Emperor Elend and King Yomen. Yomen, a pragmatist, focuses on logistics and sanitation. Elend, however, prioritizes soldier morale, walking among his troops to offer personal encouragement, a stark contrast to Yomen's scholarly approach. Elend sees himself as an evolving leader—part scholar, rebel, nobleman, Mistborn, and soldier—still finding his way amidst a world on the brink.

Visiting Yomen's infirmary, Elend grapples with immense guilt, realizing Ruin manipulated him into trusting the koloss, intending to turn them against him. He feels responsible for Fadrex's impending doom but remains committed to protecting its people. A new crisis emerges as a boy suffers from Mistsickness, a mysterious ailment Elend recognizes from his own past pain, leaving him to wonder about its true nature and the absent mist spirit.
