Yomen, convinced the Lord Ruler lives and orchestrated his own "death" and Vin's rise, interrogates her to understand her role in his god's grand plan. Ruin whispers, questioning Vin's discomfort with being worshipped. Vin grapples with guilt, realizing she isn't Kelsier's heir but has fulfilled the Lord Ruler's role, conquering and reshaping the empire. She confronts Yomen, understanding he cannot kill her without interfering with his god's supposed will, and he needs information only she can provide.

Yomen suddenly attacks, pinning Vin and demanding she order Elend's army away. He argues his city's food cache is more valuable than the other caches or atium, which he deems worthless without the old empire's economy. Vin reveals her true motivation for taking the city: the Lord Ruler's hidden atium supply. Yomen scoffs, asserting atium holds no real value to a starving man.

As guards drag Vin away, Yomen remains resolute, believing the Lord Ruler left him the food to re-establish his power and awaits further instructions. Vin's profound realization about her identity as the Lord Ruler's successor, coupled with the stark disagreement over atium's true worth, hints at escalating conflicts and revelations.
