As the world crumbles under volcanic ash, a far greater threat than the mists, Elend returns to camp with a massive new koloss army, surprising Ham. Elend immediately asks about Vin, learning a messenger was sent to Yomen but without news. Elend reassures Ham that Vin lives, revealing she controls some koloss whose continued obedience confirms her survival.

Ham delivers grim news: the empire collapses, with cities falling to lava, widespread famine, and Luthadel in dire straits. Elend grapples with the mist spirit's cryptic warning not to attack Fadrex, unsure if he can trust it. Despite this, he decides to attack Fadrex at dawn, believing it's the only way to rescue Vin and access vital supplies. He orders a surprise assault, with koloss leading the charge to break defenses, followed by his human soldiers. The coming dawn will reveal if Elend's bold decision to attack Fadrex can save his people and his queen.
