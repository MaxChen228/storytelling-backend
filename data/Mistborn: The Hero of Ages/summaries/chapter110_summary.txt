Ruin, now free, exerts a stronger influence, beginning with the mentally unstable to spike important figures like King Penrod. Meanwhile, Elend flies through the Mists, a powerful Mistborn using coins instead of Vin's method. He relishes the freedom but cannot escape the weight of his responsibilities: Vin's capture, the collapsing empire, and his starving people. He dismisses assassinating Yomen, realizing he needs a different strategy.

Elend decides diplomacy is over and heads northeast to find a koloss army, hoping to use them as leverage against Yomen. He soon discovers a burning village under attack by koloss. Witnessing the destruction, Elend engages the monstrous creatures, fighting with surprising strength. He questions their origins, wondering if they were once people transformed by the Lord Ruler.

Initially seeking an army, Elend finds himself fighting to protect the villagers, realizing how many he has failed. He confronts a massive koloss, matching its immense power, feeling an unnatural strength. He slays beast after beast, driven by a fierce desire to defend his subjects. As Elend battles, he wonders if this newfound strength can truly protect his people, hinting at a deeper power or a greater challenge to come.
