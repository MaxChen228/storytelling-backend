Vin downs her metals, attempting a daring escape from the cavern. Pushing off coins, she struggles against blinding light and a secured trapdoor. A man, Telden Hasting—an old acquaintance of Elend’s—steps in, calmly explaining his mission: to get Vin to drink drugged wine for safe transport to King Yomen, who waits above.

Telden’s disarming demeanor, reminiscent of a carefree Elend, initially confuses Vin. He offers two wines, one sedated, and drinks the pure one, claiming Yomen provides comforts even for those sent to die. Vin realizes Telden can signal Yomen to remove the stone once she's incapacitated, giving him the power to free them.

Vin threatens Telden with Allomancy and violence, but he remains unswayed, asserting loyalty to Yomen and indifference to the workers. He reveals his past philosophical discussions with Elend, highlighting his lack of concern for the skaa. Telden's unwavering resolve and Yomen's calculated plan suggest a deeper, more complex game is at play.
