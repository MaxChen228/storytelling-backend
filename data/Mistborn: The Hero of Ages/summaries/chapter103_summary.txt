The Lord Ruler confesses his failure to defeat "the thing" (Ruin), a constant companion whispering destruction for centuries. He admits he has no solution, expecting death if this is read. He wrote this in steel, exposing his weakness, to anger Ruin and benefit his empire. He questions his twisted rule, believing Ruin too powerful, destined to destroy all.

Yet, the "Hero of Ages" cares. He reveals a crucial detail: Ruin's power is incomplete, its body hidden well. Vin reads the plate with crushing frustration, finding little hope. She clings to the cryptic mention of a hidden body.

Suddenly, a grinding sound echoes through the darkness as the cavern door begins to open.
