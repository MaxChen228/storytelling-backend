Elend arrives, wounding the Inquisitor with coins. A powerful Mistborn, he joins Vin. The Inquisitor expects a stalemate, but Elend's Push throws it back, revealing his raw power. As koloss swarm, the Inquisitor recovers, throwing Vin aside, shattering Elend’s cane. It moves with unnatural speed, grabbing a metal spike. Vin, unable to help, flares brass, Soothing a koloss, which crushes the Inquisitor's head.

Elend then unleashes powerful emotional Allomancy, Soothing thousands of koloss, halting the army. His immense power secures victory, leaving his Soothed army under his command.
