Sazed is at the Pits of Hathsin, reflecting on its brutal history and ancient Allomancy. He advises Terris elders on logistics, but they press him to become their leader, seeing him as a wise Keeper. His unusual decision not to wear his copperminds symbolizes his internal struggle.

Sazed refuses, citing his past disgrace with the Keeper Synod and his profound religious crisis, feeling unworthy. Despite his apathy, he asks about "mist deaths"—people dying in daytime mists. The Terris elders dismiss this as a skaa tale, confirming their people work unharmed in the mists during the day, a fact Sazed finds perplexing.

Though overwhelmed, a spark compels Sazed to continue his research for Elend and Vin. Sazed prepares to leave the Pits, compelled to continue his research for Elend and Vin, carrying the mystery of the mist deaths and his unresolved grief, knowing he cannot be the leader the Terris need.
