Vin finds Allomantic jumping difficult in her ball gown, the fabric creating drag and noise. Elend follows less smoothly, less practiced in Allomancy. They approach Keep Orielle, a vibrant beacon in the mists, hosting a grand ball. Vin, abandoning subtlety, drops directly onto the castle steps with Elend, their dramatic arrival stunning the greeting servants.

A servant tries to block them; Elend, pewter-fueled, shoves him aside as the other flees for guards. Inside, whispering nobility parts for them. Vin feels profound confidence, a stark contrast to her first ball, now secure in her identity as Empress, Hero of Ages. A pale servant announces them: "High Emperor, Lord Elend Venture, and the Empress Vin Venture, Heir of the Survivor, Hero of Ages."

The grand ballroom falls silent as Vin and Elend survey the glittering aristocracy, Elend noting their apparent obliviousness. Vin quickly plans to mingle among the crowd, complicating any attack by approaching guards. As guards surely approach, Vin and Elend prepare to navigate the shocked ballroom, their presence a challenge to the established order.
