Elend Venture, Second Emperor, wields immense, newly acquired power, yet fears his ignorance could shatter the world. Though a scholar, not a warrior, he now leads his raw army in a surprise attack on a koloss camp. Flaring pewter for strength and steel to hurl coins, Elend fights on the front lines, using brass to Soothe his terrified soldiers and instill courage. He notes his unusual strength in emotional Allomancy, a power recently gained from its very source, but finds the koloss resistant to his influence, hinting at a deeper control over them.

As the koloss frenzy, their numbers overwhelm the human line. Elend battles tirelessly, shoring up weak points, even as the city leader, Fatren, succumbs to despair, accusing Elend of leading them to ruin. Just as his forces buckle, Elend points to a growing speck in the sky, revealing it to be the first of the promised armies, arriving just in time. The arrival of these reinforcements promises a dramatic shift in the desperate fight for survival.
