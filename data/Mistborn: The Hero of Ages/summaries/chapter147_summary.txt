Marsh, controlled by Ruin, reveals Hemalurgy created Ruin's army. Koloss turn on their own as Ruin demands atium. Vin steals Marsh's metals, duralumin-Pushes her earring through his head, seemingly killing him. She urges Yomen to fortify the city and shelter Elend's men. When Yomen hesitates, Vin orders her koloss to attack his men, forcing him to retreat and open the city gates.

Marsh shockingly revives, demonstrating Inquisitor healing and Feruchemical strength, boasting control over the Lord Ruler's faithful. Vin attempts to duralumin-Sooth and Push him, encountering a powerful mental wall. In desperation, she draws upon the Mists, unleashing a surge of power to Push Marsh's emotions, cracking his defenses and glimpsing Ruin's essence, distinct from the Mists, before he flees, leaving Vin to ponder the Mists' power as she prepares to join the battle.
