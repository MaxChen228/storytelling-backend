Elend unveils a map illustrating the mists' relentless advance, revealing a rapidly shrinking area capable of sustaining crops. Vin, observing from the shadows, notes the grim reality: over ninety percent of the empire will soon be barren, and even the small remaining bubble will vanish by winter. Cett, ever cynical, questions the map's utility, while the others grapple with the impending horror. Vin's mind echoes Reen's paranoia, but Kelsier's lessons of trust and survival also resonate.

The group debates desperate options. Breeze suggests the Well of Ascension, but Vin confirms its power is gone, used up. Ham proposes cultivating low-light plants like mushrooms, though Elend doubts their ability to feed an empire. Elend, recognizing the Lord Ruler's past preparations, shifts focus. He reveals their true enemy isn't just the mists, but "the thing that was trapped in the Well of Ascension." Vin instantly recognizes it as Ruin, a force destined to destroy everything.

Elend concludes they must secure the Lord Ruler's final storage cache, believing it holds crucial knowledge or resources to combat this existential threat.
