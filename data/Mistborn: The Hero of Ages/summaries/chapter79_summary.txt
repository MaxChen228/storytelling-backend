Vin finds Elend, now a sharp Mistborn, after he speaks with a messenger. The news is dire: koloss attack supply lines, and Luthadel faces riots, cutting off support. Elend, however, sees their enemy's deliberate orchestration, realizing these events aim to pull them from Fadrex and prevent them from discovering a vital secret.

Silently agreeing to stay, knowing Ruin listens, Vin feels the weight of their decision. With Luthadel crumbling, there is no retreat; their only path is to take Fadrex and uncover the Lord Ruler's hidden clue, perhaps the atium she feels drawn to. Later, Vin attempts to draw power from the mists, sensing a trapped strength and a mysterious blockage, leaving her frustrated and questioning their refusal. Their commitment to Fadrex solidifies, but Vin's unresolved connection to the mists hints at a deeper power yet to be understood.
