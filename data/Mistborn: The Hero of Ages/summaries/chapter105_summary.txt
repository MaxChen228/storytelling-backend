Sazed feels guilty, enjoying his studies instead of leading the city's overthrow. Breeze, the Soother, argues for delegation, reminding Sazed that leadership is about enabling others. He challenges Sazed's worries about Tindwyl, suggesting she loved him for himself, not a politician. Sazed's deeper struggle involves his avoided religious studies, fearing they hold no answers, a truth he knows he must eventually confront.

Sazed voices apprehension about Spook leading the takeover, finding him unseasoned and suspiciously determined. Breeze, however, sees Spook's growing reputation as a potential echo of Kelsier's influence. Spook, exhausted, joins them, uneasy about the lack of attack. He reveals Quellion's cunning rise: exploiting the Mists by declaring the faithful safe, then using the Mists' killings to identify "pure" individuals and incite them against nobility, cleverly omitting that nobles never died in the Mists. Sazed's sudden "Wait," hints at a critical flaw in Quellion's narrative.
