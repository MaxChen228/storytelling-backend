The Lord Ruler suppressed technology like gunpowder to prevent skaa revolts, ensuring peasant uprisings always failed. Vin and Elend discuss the enigmatic Mist Spirit; Vin believes it tried to stop her from releasing Ruin and led Sazed to uncover Ruin's text alterations. She contrasts its faint presence with Ruin's vast, omnipresent power, which hears and sees all.

Vin reveals she promised an informant to stop the ashfall and turn the sun yellow, feeling it's her destiny. Elend initially questions this, recalling Ruin's twisted prophecies. Yet, realizing Vin needs his unwavering trust and support, he pledges to help her "save the world" and stop the ash, admitting his earlier idea of divided efforts was wrong.

Vin then reveals she cannot speak her plans aloud because Ruin hears or reads anything they communicate. She explains she married Elend for his unparalleled trust, needing his hope—a bond Ruin cannot comprehend. Elend affirms his trust. With their shared purpose solidified, Vin now holds a secret plan that could be their only hope against Ruin's pervasive influence.
