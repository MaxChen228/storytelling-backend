A soldier verifies Vin isn't a kandra with a mundane question she answers correctly. Yomen confirms Vin's identity, then reveals his true purpose: not leverage, but execution. Her crime, he states, is the Lord Ruler's murder, and he, as the law, needs no trial.

Yomen warns guards will kill her for putting anything "unapproved" in her mouth. Ruin's voice, as Reen, urges attack, but Vin resists, doubting motives and ability. She suspects Yomen has a clever, hidden reason for keeping her alive, despite his stated intent.

Yomen gives no further hints, ordering her away. Vin faces an uncertain fate, trapped by a man with a hidden agenda.
