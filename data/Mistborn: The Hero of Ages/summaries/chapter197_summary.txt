Allomancy's origins are tied to the mists and Rashek's ascent at the Well of Ascension, where he gained instinctive knowledge of the Metallic Arts, including how to create Mistborn. Centuries later, TenSoon, a Third Generation kandra, faces trial in the sacred Trustwarren. Born seven centuries ago, he was once considered temperate, but now stands accused of the most heinous kandra crime. He is brought before the twenty Second Generation judges, led by KanPaar, and the silent, shadowed First Generation observers.

TenSoon insists on the public trial, not to sway the Seconds or Firsts, but to reach the younger kandra generations, who fill the benches. He hopes they will hear his truth and act after his inevitable condemnation. Among them is MeLaan, a Seventh Generation kandra, whose eccentric, wooden True Body exemplifies the younger generations' rebellious nature, much to the Seconds' annoyance. KanPaar, a tall kandra with crystal bones, relishes the opportunity to use TenSoon's trial to validate his long-held belief that the Third Generation is inherently flawed and needs to be brought to heel.

KanPaar believes TenSoon's conviction will restore order and orthodoxy, but TenSoon knows the Seconds are in for a significant surprise.
