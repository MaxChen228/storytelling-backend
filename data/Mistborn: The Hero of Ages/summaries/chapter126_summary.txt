Sazed unveils a magnificent contraption to restore water to the city's canals, promising a spectacular flood. Spook ensures public safety, seeing this "miracle" as crucial to undermine the Citizen's authority and rally support for the Survivor of the Flames.

Beldre confronts Spook, pleading with him to reconsider the attack on the government. She reveals the Citizen's defiant, insulting response, highlighting his belief in the Survivor's protection. Spook hesitates, torn, but Kelsier's ghostly whisper urges him to act.

Resolved, Spook dismisses Beldre's concerns, ensuring her safety as he gathers his eager soldiers and Breeze. They prepare for a night of decisive action, ready to unleash the water and challenge the Citizen's rule. The stage is set for a dramatic confrontation.
