The world crumbles under a relentless ashfall, a catastrophe the narrator struggles to comprehend, sensing a fractured presence and the name "Adonasium." TenSoon, horrified, observes the kandra's complacency, understanding the First Contract as concrete instructions, not mere ceremony. He fears becoming apathetic like his brethren, a fear that has always driven him to serve.

In his powerful wolfhound form, TenSoon navigates the ash-choked landscape to a hidden hollow. There, he unearths two iron spikes—the Blessing of Potency, stolen from OreSeur. He absorbs them, feeling an immense, innate strength surge through his muscles, making him one of the most powerful kandra alive. This Hemalurgic power, born from sacrifice, solidifies his resolve.

The First Contract commands kandra to serve "the Father" when Ruin returns. With the Father dead, TenSoon must adapt. He now heads east, determined to find Vin, believing she is the true path to fulfilling their ancient covenant.
