Telden reveals Yomen knows Vin's identity, expecting her not to harm servants, and declares a stalemate. Trapped, starving, and useless to the siege, Vin desperately needs to escape to aid Elend. Her only chance is drugged wine, risking Yomen's capture.

Vin devises a plan: drink, flare pewter to resist the drug, then use duralumin to burn it away and feign unconsciousness. She drinks, but as duralumin quickly runs out, her immunity vanishes. The drug overwhelms her, and Vin collapses, unconscious. Now, she is fully in Yomen's hands.
