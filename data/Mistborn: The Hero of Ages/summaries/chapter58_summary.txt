Sazed and Breeze await King Lekal's decision on a treaty, making him Elend's vassal. Sazed questions the morality of their coercion, but Breeze, a pragmatic Soother, argues it's strategic necessity for Lekal's people. Sazed, seeing Breeze's hidden kindness, admits his own contrary feelings stem from a profound, year-long pain. He feels unable to lead his people without finding truth.

Breeze tries to distract Sazed, but he reveals stopping his Feruchemical copperminds a year ago, having lost faith. He feels tainted and unworthy, burdened as the last Feruchemist, fearing the power's extinction. He carries his metalminds, but doubts their use.

As ash falls, Sazed refuses to speak of religions, challenging Breeze: how could a God permit suffering? He declares he will never again teach a faith that cannot answer his fundamental questions. This profound crisis of faith sets Sazed on a solitary path, seeking truth in a world he perceives as abandoned.
