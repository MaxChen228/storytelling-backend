Elend arrives at General Demoux's fortified camp, ahead of schedule, confirming their mission's success: they acquired koloss and a storage cavern, killing an Inquisitor. Vin observes Demoux's growing devotion to the Church of the Survivor, wearing the silver spear symbol. She feels uneasy about its ambiguous meaning and her role in the faith, despite Elend's political reasons for embracing it.

Elend tasks Demoux with organizing two forces: one to retrieve supplies, the other to escort refugees, led by Lord Fatren, to Luthadel. Elend emphasizes his philosophy of only recruiting willing soldiers, refusing to compel them. He awaits Sazed and Breeze's arrival.

Looking weary, Elend reveals the final cache's location: Fadrex, Cett's city. He calls for an evening meeting, declaring their grand agenda: conquering what remains of the world. A pivotal strategic discussion is imminent.
