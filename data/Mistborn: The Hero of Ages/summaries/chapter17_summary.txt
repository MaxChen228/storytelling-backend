Rashek's brief use of Preservation's power evolved from ignorant to artisan, revealing a protective mindset. He fixed problems he created, developing ash-eating microbes and enhanced plants, rather than reversing his initial planetary mistakes.

Elend leads his anxious army, preparing for forced mist immunization. He projects unwavering confidence, concealing his worries, knowing many will fall but most will recover, becoming immune. He rallies his soldiers, using Allomancy to bolster courage and invoking the Survivor, Kelsier, as their divine protector. This dangerous step is crucial before reaching Fadrex City, where unimmunized forces are vulnerable.

General Demoux questions Elend's true faith. Elend admits his struggles, but Demoux explains his profound belief: Kelsier was not just a man who Snapped in the Pits, but gained an "eternal mantle," transforming into the divine Survivor. He argues Kelsier the man died there, and the Survivor was born, granted immense power and wisdom by a higher force. As the mists creep closer, the army braces for the deadly test that will either grant immunity or claim lives.
