Rashek's persecution of the Terris religion stemmed from his desire to obscure the Hero of Ages prophecies and prevent anyone from reaching the Well of Ascension to overthrow him. Elend, Vin, Ham, and Cett prepare for a crucial night, as Elend plans to attend a ball in Fadrex City with Vin. He voices concerns about exposing himself, confirming his Mistborn status to Yomen, and placing both Mistborn in a vulnerable position.

Ham and Cett dismiss Elend's fears, believing Yomen will seek advantage rather than attack. Elend confirms the succession: Vin, then Sazed, then Cett for the army. As they talk, Vin emerges in a stunning black gown, surprising them all. Ham fondly recalls her growth from a frightened girl, while Vin hints her exquisite dress is a "Mistborn secret."

As the sun sets and mists gather, Elend and Vin depart for the ball, Pushing into the air. Ham, left with Cett, gleefully anticipates tormenting him with philosophical puzzles. A tense confrontation awaits Elend and Vin as they enter Yomen's domain.
