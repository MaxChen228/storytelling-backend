The Lord Ruler has ruled the Final Empire for a millennium, suppressing cultures and creating a rigid skaa/nobility system. Kelsier, a legendary half-breed Mistborn, recruits a crew, including the young Vin, to overthrow the tyrant. Vin infiltrates noble society, falling for the idealistic Elend Venture. Kelsier sacrifices himself, becoming a martyr who inspires the skaa rebellion. Vin, drawing on a mysterious mist power, defeats the Lord Ruler, revealing him as a powerful Feruchemist servant, not a god. The empire falls, and Elend takes control of Luthadel.

Elend's idealistic rule proves unstable as his Assembly vies for power. His father, Straff Venture, and Lord Cett besiege Luthadel, more concerned with each other. Keeper Tindwyl mentors Elend, urging realism. Despite Elend's attempts to manipulate the armies, the Assembly deposes him; he refuses to use force. Vin struggles with her identity and relationship with Elend, feeling too brutal. She also encounters a mysterious "mist spirit" and hears strange thumpings when burning bronze, echoing events from Alendi's ancient logbook. These phenomena hint at deeper mysteries surrounding the mists and the true nature of the world.
