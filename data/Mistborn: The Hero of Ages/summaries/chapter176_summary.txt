Scholar Sazed surprises kandra guards, using Feruchemy to become impossibly heavy, crushing bones, then blinding speed with a hammer to incapacitate the rest. TenSoon secures FhorKood, while Sazed discovers other cells hold not criminals, but the discolored muscles of the imprisoned First Generation kandra.

TenSoon quickly forms a plan. MeLaan retrieves bones for the First Generation's hours-long regeneration. To buy time, TenSoon forces FhorKood to relinquish his bones, then assumes his identity. He will infiltrate the Second Generation, reporting his own "capture" to KanPaar and stalling them.

Sazed remains, storing Feruchemy and guarding the recovering First Generation, eager to question them. He believes TenSoon's distraction prevents immediate threats. What harm could possibly come from waiting?
