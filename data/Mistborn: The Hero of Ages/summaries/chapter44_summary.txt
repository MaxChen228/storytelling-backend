Elend trusts Vin deeply, despite her unusual nature and mysterious methods. Vin, disliking numbers, tasks Elend with analyzing mist percentages, asking him only *what* to do, not *why*, believing this helps them stay ahead. Elend, though skeptical, agrees. He then reveals his diplomatic letter to King Yomen, but doubts its success. He needs the city for vital grain and the Lord Ruler's cache, but grapples with the moral dilemma of potentially unleashing his 20,000 koloss if diplomacy fails.

Vin then proposes a daring solution: they attend a ball inside the besieged city, where Yomen will be present. Elend is shocked but recognizes the strategic brilliance of confronting Yomen directly. He agrees to the "crazy idea," but Vin suddenly realizes she lacks a suitable gown.
