Spook directs Durn to find a powerful Soother to manipulate the city's underground against Quellion, stressing secrecy. He grapples with Kelsier's influence and his new leadership, as Kelsier warns of Quellion's dangerous instability and threats to his friends.

A man then rushes to Spook, desperate: his seven-year-old sister, Mailey, is taken by the Citizen and faces burning. Embracing Kelsier's proactive spirit, Spook agrees to help, demanding the man gather ten willing workers for a late-night operation.

Tonight, their mission to save Mailey begins.
