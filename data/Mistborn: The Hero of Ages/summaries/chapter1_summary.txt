TenSoon, an ancient kandra, is confined in a dark pit, his body a formless mass of muscles without a skeleton. He possesses vast knowledge but lacks the means to use it. Imprisoned for breaking the First Contract and betraying a vital secret, he faces maddening torture. He knows his actions threaten to doom his people to slavery, yet he believes he did the right thing.

Suddenly, his captors attempt to execute him with acid, but first drop a skull, a requirement of the First Contract. Despite searing pain as the acid begins to dissolve him, TenSoon rapidly forms a rudimentary body around the skull. With a desperate surge, he croaks: "Judgment!" This act halts the execution, forcing a public trial.

A voice urges him to accept death, warning a trial will expose his full betrayal, leading to worse pain. He knows vindication is impossible; his confessions damned him. Yet, he repeats "Judgment," knowing his decision is not for self-defense, but for "other reasons entirely." Listeners will soon discover the true purpose behind TenSoon's desperate gamble.
