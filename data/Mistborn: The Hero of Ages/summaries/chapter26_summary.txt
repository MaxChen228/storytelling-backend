Elend reviews army casualty reports with Noorden, learning nearly six thousand soldiers are sick and five hundred fifty dead. Vin feels an unease, pressing for exact percentages. Her questioning leads Noorden to recalculate, revealing precisely sixteen percent of the relevant soldiers fell sick. Elend initially dismisses it as coincidence, but Vin insists they examine other groups.

Astonishingly, every population sample Noorden examines—regardless of size, age, or location—shows exactly sixteen percent falling ill. This unnatural precision, where the sickness rate is always sixteen percent, deeply troubles Elend. He realizes this is "very wrong," acknowledging the breakdown of statistical probability. He orders further investigation. Vin senses a deeper meaning, contemplating "consequence" and "laws" tied to the number sixteen. The consistent, exact percentage hints at a profound, underlying truth about their world.
