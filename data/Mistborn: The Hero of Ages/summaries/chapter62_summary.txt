Elend and Yomen's philosophical debate quickly devolves into open animosity, as Yomen harbors deep hatred for Elend, whose wife killed his god. Elend offers Yomen kingship under his rule, promising autonomy for city access and resources, appealing to their shared concern for the people. Yomen firmly rejects the proposal, asserting he cannot be intimidated or influenced, viewing Elend's army as an unacceptable threat.

Elend then reveals his true, urgent motive: he needs to access Yomen's storage cavern, believing it holds the Lord Ruler's vital instructions and supplies for humanity's survival. Yomen denies knowledge and defiantly declares his people would rather fight and die for their god than be ruled by Elend. Seeing Yomen's resolve, Elend decides against an immediate attack, planning to let the siege continue for months. He then signals a servant, setting in motion an unrevealed plan.
