Elend targets the cache, initiating siege preparations: engineers, scouts, and spies begin their tasks. Cett suggests assassinating King Yomen, but Elend firmly rejects this, prioritizing diplomacy. He asserts his authority over Cett, reminding him of his oaths and that his future kingdom is on Elend's terms. Cett, impressed, complies.

Elend tasks Vin with scouting the city and the cache, while Cett provides names of potential informants. Elend insists on gathering more information before any direct attack. Vin, confident in her Mistborn abilities, playfully dismisses Elend's offer to join her, citing his "imperial scent" and noisiness. She takes the list and departs into the mists.

Elend's commitment to diplomacy faces the harsh realities of war, hinting at difficult choices ahead.
