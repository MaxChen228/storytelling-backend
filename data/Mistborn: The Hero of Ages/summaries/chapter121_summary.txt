Elend encounters the familiar Mist Spirit, which once stabbed him but also led Vin to his Allomancy. It points northeast, trying to guide him. When Elend asks it to write, "I will kill you. Death, death, death" appears. Elend deduces a hostile "other force," the one Vin released, is present, altering the message like Sazed's papers. He confirms this entity is here now.

Elend learns the Mist Spirit is weaker, fading, and far weaker than the "other thing," which causes ashfalls. It hints it might cause mists during the day. Crucially, it strongly advises against attacking Fadrex City and urgently points to Elend's metal vials when he mentions men dying in the mists, hinting at a vital connection.

As the Mist Spirit fades, Elend asks if they can survive. It gives a brief, hesitant wave before disappearing. Despite cryptic answers, Elend feels renewed determination, seeing unknown possibilities for survival. He returns to Fadrex, pondering the metals and the spirit's warning.
