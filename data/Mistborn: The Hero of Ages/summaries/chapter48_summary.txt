Sazed, Breeze, and Allrianne arrive with Spook at a boarded-up Ministry Canton of Inquisition building in Urteau. Spook, displaying surprising strength, easily removes boards Sazed struggles with, hinting at a significant change. Breeze notes Spook's newfound confidence and blindfold, as Spook cryptically tells Sazed he needs to discuss "things of gods and men."

Inside the mundane office, Spook unearths a hidden trapdoor, confirming Vin's prior reconnaissance. Their mission: retrieve one of the Lord Ruler's vast supply caches, hidden beneath Ministry buildings. Breeze explains Elend's dual objective: secure the supplies and quell Quellion's rebellion, arguing the immense cache cannot be moved with the city in revolt. Descending, Sazed and Breeze are stunned by the cavern's enormous cache, a testament to the Lord Ruler's grand preparations.

Now facing the cache's vastness, the group must secure these vital resources amidst the city's volatile rebellion.
