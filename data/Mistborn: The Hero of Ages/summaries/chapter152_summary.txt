The Lord Ruler created kandra from Feruchemists, but his oversight allowed more Feruchemists to be born. Sazed enters the kandra's ancient caverns, observing their unique bone bodies and their fear. He notes the small spikes in his guards' shoulders and questions their First Contract, forbidding harm to humans. The guards are unsure if the contract still holds, as their "Father" is dead.

Sazed confronts the "Second Generation" kandra leaders. He asserts his identity as a Terris Keeper and "Holy Announcer," knowing their origins. He declares that he has found the Hero, Vin, who slew the Lord Ruler, and announces that "the end is here." The leaders are shaken, sending for others as Sazed prepares his metalminds and tome.

The lead kandra, KanPaar, dismisses Sazed's claims as blasphemy, questioning why an outsider could persuade them where TenSoon failed. Sazed challenges their skepticism, pointing to the world's decay and the Lord Ruler's death. He then reveals his Keeper specialty: religion, hinting at his vast, forgotten knowledge about the world before the Lord Ruler's Ascension. Listeners should anticipate Sazed unveiling the forgotten truths of their world, challenging the very foundations of kandra belief.
