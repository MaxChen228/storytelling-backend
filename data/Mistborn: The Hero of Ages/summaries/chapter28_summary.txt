Vin plunges into the koloss army, immediately unleashing Allomancy. She Pushes horseshoes and coins, Pulls swords, and uses enhanced pewter strength to dispatch foes with brutal efficiency. Koloss, baffled by her small stature, are drawn to her lethal prowess. Vin fights not from fear for Elend, but with a newfound peace; she is "Elend's knife," protecting his vision and the people he champions. Her goal isn't to slaughter all ten thousand, but to sow fear.

As a massive, thirteen-foot koloss advances, Vin prepares. She burns duralumin, amplifying her pewter and steel into an explosive Push that scatters koloss and rips weapons from their grasp. After quickly restoring her metals, she charges the giant. She plants her sword to brace against its colossal swing, then leaps, kicking the behemoth directly in the head. The giant koloss collapses, its skull cracked.

The surrounding koloss freeze, stunned by her impossible feat. Vin understands that in a normal army, this would earn their obedience. However, this particular koloss army is controlled by an external force, hinting at a deeper, more insidious threat.
