Vin confronts Slowswift, a reluctant informant who initially refuses to betray his city or liege. He dismisses offers of power or money, asserting he sells stories, not his soul. Vin challenges him, highlighting the world's impending doom—falling ash, deadly mists, and escalating earthquakes. She reveals her identity as the "Heir of the Survivor," destined to stop it. Swayed by this dire truth and Vin's potential, Slowswift agrees to help.

He describes Yomen as an honorable but mediocre leader, whose unwavering belief in the Lord Ruler is a weakness. Slowswift also exposes Yomen's suspiciously vast, unaccounted-for wealth, which Vin immediately recognizes as the atium cache. After imparting this intelligence, Slowswift demands payment, explaining that a story without cost is deemed worthless. Vin pays him with gold imperials before departing.

Vin then seeks a second informant, Hoid, but her instincts scream danger, causing her to abandon the meeting. Trusting her gut, she instead follows Cett's instructions to the Canton of Resource, a massive and imposing building. She now prepares to confront the secrets held within the Canton of Resource.
