Vin feels exposed traveling with five thousand villagers. She walks apart, her only companion a massive koloss she controls through Allomancy. The beast keeps others at bay, but Vin senses its constant struggle against her will. She doesn't fully understand these creatures, only that the Lord Ruler kept them separate.

Suddenly, the koloss speaks, its voice deliberate. It calls itself "Human" and chillingly declares its intention to kill Vin, take human cities, to "be human." Vin shivers at its ambition and surprising intelligence. When she asks about female or baby koloss, "Human" cryptically states, "New koloss come from us," leaving their reproduction a disturbing mystery.

As the group approaches a canal, Vin uses her Allomancy to scout ahead. She discovers a vast military encampment of fifty thousand soldiers along the canal route. Elend soon joins her, a rare smile gracing his face as they survey the bustling camp and waiting scouts. Their arrival at this massive military hub suggests significant strategic developments are imminent.
