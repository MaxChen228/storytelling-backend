MeLaan confronts TenSoon, accusing him of returning only to die, broken by his past. TenSoon denies this, insisting he serves his people by accepting punishment. He struggles to explain his dog body, which MeLaan finds distasteful, clarifying Vin, not Zane, gave him the bones.

Though planning to submit, TenSoon subtly asks MeLaan about the dog bones' location, then dismisses them as disgraceful. He insists he won't rebel, urging her to leave, protecting her from association. He secretly hopes for a slim chance of escape.

TenSoon's true intentions regarding the discarded bones remain a mystery.
