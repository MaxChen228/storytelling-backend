Marsh sits in a stagnant koloss camp, feeling Ruin’s attention elsewhere. He struggles internally against the false bliss Ruin offers and his own despair, reflecting on his past failure to lead the skaa rebellion. He grapples with guilt, believing Kelsier’s actions ultimately worsened things, yet acknowledges Kelsier died for Mare’s dream. Marsh realizes he is repeating his past inaction, giving up when he should fight.

Observing the koloss army's pointless self-destruction, Marsh questions Ruin's delayed attack and why he, the most powerful Inquisitor, is left alone. He realizes Ruin isn't omnipotent and cannot read his thoughts. A new resolve sparks: he will feign compliance, then, at the opportune moment, remove his own spike, killing himself. This sacrifice, mirroring Kelsier’s, aims to disrupt Ruin’s plans and give others a fighting chance. Marsh's desperate plan to sacrifice himself for the world now hinges on his ability to deceive Ruin.
