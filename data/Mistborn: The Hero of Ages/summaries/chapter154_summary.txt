Marsh kneels in endless ash, consumed by self-loathing, a puppet of Ruin. He clings to a sliver of hope, having witnessed Ruin's fear of Vin. Though Ruin controls his body and mind, Marsh secretly plans to break free and end his life, a desperate rebellion. Ruin, distracted, compels Marsh to travel, Pushing through the ash-choked sky.

Marsh descends, encountering a determined soldier braving mists and deep ash. Ruin finds the man "beautiful," and Marsh, compelled, brutally attacks. The soldier fights back fiercely, even attempting to pull the spike from Marsh's back. As the soldier falls, he tries to destroy a folded metal sheet. Ruin, desperate, forces Marsh to sever the man's arm and head, then compels him to read the message aloud, revealing Ruin's inability to read metal.

The message, from Spook, warns Vin that "the thing we fight is real," controlling people through metal piercings and even appearing as Kelsier. Spook urges Vin not to trust anyone pierced by metal, as even a small piece can taint them. Immediately, Ruin crumples and destroys the vital message, then propels Marsh towards Luthadel. Vin now faces a hidden enemy whose methods are revealed, but the crucial warning is tragically lost.
