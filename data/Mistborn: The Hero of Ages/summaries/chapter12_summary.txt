Tin savant Spook struggles with incredibly heightened senses from constant metal burning, making normal life agonizing. He awakens in darkness, his room sealed and senses muffled by blindfolds. Burning tin instinctively, he believes this power is vital for Urteau's survival against impending dangers, despite the personal cost.

He replenishes his tin supply, knowing Elend’s team is coming to quell Urteau's rebellion. Spook must gather intelligence before their arrival, so he dons special spectacles covered by a cloth to filter the intense daylight.

Armed with his dueling cane and unique vision, Spook steps out, ready to prepare for the coming conflict.
