Inside a burning building, Spook guides prisoners to a hidden passage. A soldier takes a girl hostage, but Spook breaks his knees and, influenced by the voice of Kelsier, leaves him to burn. The secret door proves too strong, but Spook, burning pewter, embraces the intense heat to carry the whimpering girl through the flames.

Outside, Sazed, Breeze, and Allrianne watch the inferno. Sazed questions the escalating violence, while Allrianne subtly Riots the crowd, stirring anger against Quellion. Suddenly, a boarded window shatters, and a figure leaps from the roof, cloaked in smoke and fire, carrying a child.

It's Spook, blindfolded, landing with impossible grace. Breeze and Allrianne unleash a full riot, distracting Quellion's soldiers. Spook seizes the moment, fleeing with the rescued girl as the crowd surges. Quellion, frustrated, orders a retreat, leaving Spook's new abilities and mysterious blindfold to hint at a powerful, yet uncertain, future.
