Screams shatter the night, rousing Vin. Elend's camp is under attack by Yomen's mounted forces, but the king's strategic planning, exposing his men to the mists, saves them. Vin, proud, flares pewter and steel, soaring to the southern front where cavalry breaches defenses. She notes Yomen's careful, stone-tipped spears, feeling adrenaline after days of waiting.

Landing amidst the riders, Vin unleashes her Allomancy. She unhorses soldiers, rips tents, and uses stakes as deadly projectiles, creating chaos. She revels in the challenge and power of Pushes and Pulls, quickly routing dozens. As riders withdraw, Vin senses a powerful Mistborn watching.

Without hesitation, Vin pursues the mysterious Allomancer. He is too short for Elend, and his movements are serious, not playful. The chase leads them from camp into Fadrex City, leaping over rooftops. Vin, frustrated by his skill, pushes herself to her limits, determined to catch her elusive quarry. Who is this skilled Allomancer, and what secrets does he hold within Fadrex City?
