Yomen confronts Vin, declaring it's time for her execution decision, but it quickly becomes an interrogation. He questions her presence in Fadrex City; Vin admits they sought a Lord Ruler cache and that Elend's army was outside, defending Elend's sincerity. Vin feels unnerved, like a tool, recalling Reen's advice to make herself indispensable. Unseen by Yomen, Ruin circles him, disappointed by his lack of ambition.

Yomen then probes Vin about the Church of the Survivor and Kelsier's worship, revealing his belief that the Lord Ruler is not dead, but merely "disappeared." Vin recounts the Lord Ruler's demise in detail, including Sazed's theory of his Feruchemical and Allomantic immortality. Yomen listens intently, valuing the information.

Despite Vin's honest account, Yomen remains unconvinced. He poses a chilling final question: why the Lord Ruler would want Vin to *think* she had killed him. This suggests a grand deception, hinting at a deeper, unsettling layer to the Lord Ruler's supposed defeat.
