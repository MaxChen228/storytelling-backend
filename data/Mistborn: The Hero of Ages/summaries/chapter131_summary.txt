Preservation sacrificed his consciousness to imprison Ruin, leaving his power for humanity, a remnant Ruin now suffocates. Vin, Yomen's prisoner, plans to fool her captors by giving them what they expect, feigning weakness in her meticulously designed, hazekiller-guarded cell.

Vin stages a violent escape with a wooden leg, then allows herself to be recaptured. Later, in Yomen's chamber, she slips her greased manacles and throws silver screws, feigning a Steelpush. Yomen, however, calmly dodges, revealing he burns atium and anticipated her every move. Ruin appears to Vin, mocking her failure.

Vin confronts Yomen, who denies being Mistborn but admits to burning atium. He asserts he never lies and declares that "it is time" for something significant. Vin feels increasingly blind to Elend's actions, sensing a larger, unseen game. Listeners should anticipate a pivotal moment approaching, as Yomen's cryptic words hint at a grand scheme unfolding.
