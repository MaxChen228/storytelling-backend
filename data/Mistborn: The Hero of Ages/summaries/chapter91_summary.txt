Vin navigates the ballroom, focused on her mission and avoiding social pleasantries. She observes the guards, then, burning bronze, discovers two Allomancers—a copper and a tin burner—expertly tailing her. Realizing Yomen isn't underestimating her, Vin's new challenge is to lose her shadows. She spots Slowswift and, in a quick, cryptic exchange, instructs him to send two trusted men to the secluded patio and to tell Elend she needs another half hour. Vin then heads to the lantern-lit patio, her tails following, and soon Slowswift's men arrive. She waits patiently, trusting Elend to create a diversion.

Elend's distraction arrives: a man rushes out, drawing away the patio's other occupants. With the space now empty, Vin seizes the moment. She Pushes against the railing, launching herself across the patio. Her tails, momentarily distracted, are slow to react as Vin flies past. One of the women opens her mouth to yell.
