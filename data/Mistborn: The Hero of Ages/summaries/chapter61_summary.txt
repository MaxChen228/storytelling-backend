Elend approaches Yomen at the ball, his presence silencing the room. He sits across from the composed obligator, whose meal remains untouched, a stark contrast to Elend's own struggles to feed his people. Trusting Vin and his own powers, Elend immediately offers an alliance, presenting himself not as an emperor seeking conquest, but as a desperate king seeking allies to face a world that seems to be falling apart, proposing they pool resources and end their wars.

Yomen, unsmiling, dismisses Elend's sincerity, calling him "flagrant and garish" and accusing him of ruling by force. He highlights Elend's hypocrisy, noting how Luthadel's people chose Penrod, only for Elend to reclaim the city with his Mistborn. Yomen champions stability and "true authority" derived from the Lord Ruler, while Elend defends his right to liberate the city and uphold the people's rule. Despite their clash, Elend recognizes a specific phrase Yomen uses – "Only a man chosen by the Lord Ruler has that claim on authority" – as originating from "Durton."

The revelation of this shared, mysterious source of ideology, "Durton," promises to uncover deeper truths about their world.
