Sazed, battling depression and questioning his faith, discusses frequent earthquakes with Breeze. Captain Goradel interrupts, announcing Lord Spook’s return. Spook enters, eyes uncovered, displaying a hardened resolve and bloodied, burned clothes—a stark transformation. He immediately outlines an urgent plan to take Urteau: Breeze will spread rumors exposing Quellion’s hypocrisy (using Allomancers, holding families hostage), while Sazed uses his engineering knowledge to flood the city streets.

Sazed is troubled by Spook's changes and unexplained survival. Though Spook briefly falters, asking for trust, Sazed sees his genuine care for the city. Overcoming despair, Sazed agrees to use his metalminds. A daring infiltration and public unmasking now loom.
