Sazed shaves his head in Terris tradition when Vin appears, her stealth remarkable. She questions his ways, but Sazed confesses profound grief over Tindwyl, feeling weak, selfish, and lost, unable to move past loss or embrace his role.

Vin tries to reassure him, then reveals they've found a stockpile and gives him an etched copy of its contents, pleading for his help, stating she cannot fight alone. Vin then shares a shocking confession: at the Well of Ascension, she held immense power and chose to release it, letting Elend seemingly die, because she understood it was what he wanted, a lesson Sazed taught.

Before leaving, Vin gives Sazed a mysterious drawing of a strange flower, a memento from Mare, urging him to examine the etching. Sazed promises to consider it, his path forward uncertain. Anticipate Sazed's internal conflict and the stockpile's secrets.
