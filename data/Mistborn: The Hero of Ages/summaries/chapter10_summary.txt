The Mists burn and retreat, no longer Vin’s familiar protectors but an alien, quivering force. She senses their unnatural change, feeling them withdraw like a person fleeing, a stark contrast to Sazed’s theories. Her connection, amplified by the Well of Ascension, tells her they are alive and shifting. Meanwhile, Elend prepares his army to move, prioritizing speed to Fadrex over safety.

He plans to expose his soldiers to the Mists daily, believing immunity is crucial for their campaign, despite Ham’s passionate objections about the inevitable casualties. Vin, though sympathetic to Ham’s attachment to his men, supports Elend’s difficult strategic decision, recognizing the army cannot remain dependent on the Mists’ whims. Elend, however, grapples with the harsh reality of ordering men to their deaths.

As the camp mobilizes, Vin misses TenSoon and notes the scarcity of kandra, while a koloss causes unease. The army now faces a direct confrontation with the Mists, and the true nature of this evolving threat will soon be revealed.
