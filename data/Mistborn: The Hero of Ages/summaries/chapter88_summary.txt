Vin observes Elend in the cavern, noting his hardened resolve despite self-perceived failures. She misses his old idealism but admires his enduring hope. Elend marvels at the Lord Ruler's vast, hidden food depots, interpreting this monumental effort as a sign the Lord Ruler believed the Deepness could be defeated, fueling his own conviction they can survive the encroaching mists and ashfall.

Vin struggles with Elend's optimism, highlighting the worsening environmental decay and the futility of fighting an unstoppable force. She questions their purpose, even criticizing Kelsier's martyrdom. Despite their strained exchange, Elend remains steadfast, focusing on immediate threats like the gathering koloss. Deeper in the cavern, they discover a metal plate inscribed by the Lord Ruler.

The plate describes malatium, Kelsier's Eleventh Metal, revealing its power to show a person's potential past. It warns against the destructive mists and reveals a crucial weakness: koloss and kandra can be controlled by several people Pushing on their emotions simultaneously. This offers a glimmer of hope. Vin points to the other side of the plate, suggesting more secrets await.
