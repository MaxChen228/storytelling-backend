Sazed excitedly theorizes about the Citizen, a new "Survivor" figure, predicting a dynamic religion with successive leaders and potential factions. Breeze, annoyed by Sazed's theorizing, remains focused on their mission. Allrianne shrewdly notes the Citizen could become a rival for city leadership.

They await Quellion's executions. Sazed's excitement deflates as the Citizen arrives in his unique blue costume. He resists intervening, knowing it jeopardizes their larger plan. He reluctantly follows Breeze and Allrianne into the crowd, resolving to focus on his duties. The crowd presses forward, ready to witness the grim spectacle.
