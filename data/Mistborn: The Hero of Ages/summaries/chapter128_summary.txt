Spook prepares to execute Quellion, but Beldre, his sister, intervenes, striking Spook with a coin and revealing herself as an Allomancer. Kelsier, now visible, confirms Beldre was Quellion's assassin. The crowd turns on Beldre, and Kelsier demands Spook kill her with a steel spike for power.

Spook sees the city burning, realizing Kelsier's vision is destruction. Quellion, perceiving Kelsier, pleads. Kelsier instructs Spook to kill Beldre with a spike and drive it into himself. Instead, Spook examines Quellion, finding a bronze spike in his arm. Pulling it free, Kelsier screams in rage.

Spook then realizes a metal shard from a past injury protrudes from his own shoulder—a spike Kelsier had told him to leave. As Spook reaches for it, Kelsier screams a desperate "No!" This shocking discovery promises to unravel Kelsier's manipulative game and reveal the true source of Spook's own strength.
