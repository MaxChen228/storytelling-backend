Ruin chose Vin, a Mistborn with an insane mother and Seeker sister, uniquely positioned to gain a Hemalurgic spike for bronze power to locate the Well of Ascension.

Day breaks without mists, but ash falls heavier and the sun burns with unnatural heat. Elend surveys the koloss-strewn battlefield, thankful Fadrex survived but perplexed by the retreat. Sensing a deeper wrong, he instructs Yomen to organize rescue and prepare for the unknown. Trusting Vin, Elend decides he must leave to find her. Yomen, now respectful, reveals himself as an atium Misting, giving Elend his last bead, convinced it's the Lord Ruler's plan.

With atium in hand, Elend streaks across the landscape, determined to reunite with Vin and face what comes next.
