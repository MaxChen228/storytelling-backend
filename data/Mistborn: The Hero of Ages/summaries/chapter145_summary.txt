Elend prepares to attack Fadrex City with his koloss, but grapples with the morality of conquest. After consulting Ham and reflecting on Vin, he makes a difficult decision. He orders his forces to retreat, refusing to conquer the city and prioritizing his ideals, even if it means finding another way to save Vin.

Inside Fadrex, Vin watches Elend's retreat with relief. She confronts Ruin and Marsh, revealing she knew Ruin was manipulating her to find the atium. Vin explains Ruin's critical weakness: metal blinds him, preventing him from directly perceiving atium, allowing her to lead him on a ruse. Marsh violently demands the atium, but Vin refuses. Ruin insists Vin cannot fight him and doesn't understand the atium's true nature. He then manipulates Yomen, ordering a suicidal assault against Elend's koloss. Despite Yomen's distress, Ruin's manipulation of his faith compels him to comply, believing the Lord Ruler will protect his men.

This desperate, faith-driven charge sets the stage for a brutal and unexpected confrontation.
