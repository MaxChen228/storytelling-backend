Cett and Ham observe Demoux's prolonged illness, fueling camp rumors that the mist sickness punishes those lacking faith. Elend initially dismisses this but recalls his own past words declaring Kelsier the Lord of the Mists, implying the sickness is his will. This complicates Elend's internal conflict over the Fadrex siege. He chafes at waiting, capable of taking the city by force but unwilling to sacrifice thousands. His perception of Yomen as reasonable intensifies his moral dilemma. Hoping to avoid invasion, Elend plans for Vin to infiltrate the heavily guarded cavern during an upcoming ball, seeking the Lord Ruler's final message.

After reports, Demoux resigns, convinced his lingering illness is Kelsier's punishment for his lack of faith, citing Elend's own words. He then reveals a crucial statistic: of 5,000 sick soldiers, 500 died, and most others recovered quickly. However, a distinct group, like Demoux, remained ill for weeks. This unexplained pattern suggests a hidden purpose behind the mists' effects, which Elend must now investigate.
