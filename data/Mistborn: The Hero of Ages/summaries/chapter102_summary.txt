Freed, Ruin now directly impacts the world, intensifying ashfall, causing earthquakes, and controlling entire koloss armies. Vin, trapped in a dark cavern after accidentally releasing it, grapples with regret and fear. Ruin speaks to her through Reen's voice, a chilling presence that seems to read her thoughts. Yet, Vin clings to the Lord Ruler's promise that Ruin cannot read minds, realizing its influence is more subtle, manipulating emotions rather than directly accessing her thoughts.

Days pass in suffocating darkness as Vin analyzes Ruin's nature. She deduces it was imprisoned long before the Lord Ruler, meaning the Deepness and deadly mists aren't a direct consequence of its recent release. She questions why Ruin hasn't simply destroyed everything, concluding it must be hindered, limited to gradual destruction. Meanwhile, Yomen has cleverly trapped her, removing all water supplies, leaving her to face dehydration and dwindling food.

As Vin scouts the vast cavern, she finds a mysterious metal plate etched with a simple circle and a dot, alongside frustrating, cryptic text. She ponders why Ruin chose her as its pawn, given the Well's accessibility. Her desperate search for answers continues, hinting that the cryptic plate might hold the key to understanding Ruin's true nature and its ancient imprisonment.
