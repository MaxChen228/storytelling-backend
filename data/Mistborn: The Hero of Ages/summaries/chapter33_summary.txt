Kelsier's "Eleventh Metal" is revealed as Ruin's subtle manipulation, a means to ensure the Lord Ruler's death and his own eventual release. Even the crew's greatest victory was orchestrated by Ruin.

Meanwhile, TenSoon grapples with his conscience. MeLaan's words haunt him: he cannot simply accept punishment while the kandra and Vin face impending doom, especially with the growing earthquakes. He feels trapped in his cage, unable to escape or provide Vin with crucial information about the kandra's origins.

Days later, VarSell brings TenSoon a sack of bones. He explains TenSoon will endure a public trial where his bones will be broken as a humiliating display. The bones provided are the despised dog body TenSoon wore upon his return. The Second Generation intends this as ultimate degradation, but as VarSell leaves, TenSoon realizes this very humiliation has given him the means to escape. Listeners should anticipate TenSoon's daring attempt to break free.
