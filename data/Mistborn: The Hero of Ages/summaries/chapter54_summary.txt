Sazed, Breeze, Spook, and Allrianne convene in Urteau's hidden underground reservoir, a pure water source engineered by the Lord Ruler for disaster. Sazed, now leading, explains its strategic purpose. Their immediate challenge is the tyrannical Citizen, Quellion. Spook advocates assassination, recalling their success with the Lord Ruler.

Breeze counters that Quellion is replaceable, unlike the Lord Ruler, and assassination would only create a new tyrant. He proposes undermining Quellion's system instead. Sazed surprisingly admits understanding Quellion's anti-nobility stance, seeing it as a twisted echo of Kelsier's teachings. Breeze and Allrianne remind Sazed of their duty to Elend and Urteau's vital resources.

Accepting action, Sazed agrees to Breeze's plan: they will first gather intelligence on the city's climate, criminal elements, and government corruption to inform their strategy. Spook still pushes for Kelsier's direct methods, but Breeze reminds him they lack Kelsier. Sazed reflects on Kelsier's enduring, yet potentially destructive, legacy of hatred towards nobility.
