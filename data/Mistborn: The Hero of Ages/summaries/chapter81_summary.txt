Pewter-enhanced, Spook watches Urteau's execution procession, riddled with doubt. Kelsier's spectral voice urges him to save condemned nobles by killing guards. Spook feels inadequate, not a true Mistborn, but a child among the prisoners and a flicker of sympathy from Quellion's sister Beldre steel his resolve. He must act.

In the basement, Spook finds a secret passage where Quellion's soldiers extract prisoners. He realizes Quellion's hypocrisy: publicly executing nobles but secretly saving valuable Allomancers. A crying child ignites Spook's fury, banishing fear. He charges, wielding his pewter-enhanced cane and daggers, quickly dispatching soldiers.

Fighting through the burning building, Spook prevents soldiers from escaping to alert Quellion. He feels a surge of power, believing he can finally fight like Kelsier and Vin. Defeating the last soldier, he spins, finding the final one holding a young girl hostage with Spook's own knife.
