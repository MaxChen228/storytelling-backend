Sazed, Breeze, and Allrianne confront Quellion, who views Elend Venture as a tyrant. A Kelsier loyalist, he champions anti-nobility ideals, questioning Sazed's loyalty and Kelsier's 'peace'. He tries to shame Breeze, but Breeze's bluff leaves Quellion unsettled. Sazed warns of escalating dangers: deadly mists, ashfall, and koloss, proposing an alliance with Emperor Venture, who controls koloss and offers resources. Quellion dismisses these as threats, trusting only the Survivor, and orders them out.

Despite the rejection, Sazed insists on staying peacefully. Quellion reluctantly permits it, warning them to follow laws, but Sazed's continued presence hints at deeper exploration of the city's secrets.
