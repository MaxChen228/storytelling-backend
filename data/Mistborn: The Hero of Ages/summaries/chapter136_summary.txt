Sazed completes his year-long study, meticulously sifting through every known religion, only to eliminate them all. He finds each faith riddled with inconsistencies, logical fallacies, and a profound inability to explain why their gods permitted Rashek's atrocities and the suffering of the faithful. Overwhelmed by grief for Tindwyl and a deep sense of betrayal, Sazed feels numb, his hope extinguished. His portfolio, once a quest for truth, now signifies only emptiness. He contemplates burning it all, reflecting on Kelsier's motto: "Better to trust and be betrayed," acknowledging the deep pain of a faith that failed him.

He pulls out a thick tome compiled with Tindwyl about the Hero of Ages, finding Vin's flower inside—a past symbol of hope. Sazed desperately yearns to believe, pleading for "something real, something true," beyond shadows and memories. As he stands, consumed by his crisis, he overhears Breeze and TenSoon in the hallway. TenSoon mentions needing to find Vin and asks Breeze to "Give my regards to the Announcer." The word "Announcer" jolts Sazed, breaking through his despair. He bursts into the hallway, seeking answers.
