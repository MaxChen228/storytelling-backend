Spook drops his weapon and narrowly dodges an enemy sword, realizing he can't fight with Quellion's Allomancy interfering. As he tries to escape, a "dead" soldier, revealed as a pewter-burning Thug, grabs him. Spook grapples the Thug, using him as a shield, but a third soldier, also a Thug, brutally impales them both, a move reflecting Quellion's harsh philosophy.

Spook stumbles, feeling blood but no pain, before collapsing into darkness. He wonders why these Allomancers are trying to remain hidden. What secret power allows Spook to defy such a fatal blow?
