Vin brutally incapacitates two spy women with a duralumin-fueled Brasspush, rendering them unconscious. She orders allies to hide them and her dress, creating a diversion. Shedding her formal attire for combat clothes, Vin slips into a hidden stairwell, relying on Elend’s distraction.

Meanwhile, Elend confronts Yomen, proposing a duel to decide the city’s fate; his true goal is prolonged distraction. He skillfully debates Yomen, shifting arguments from honor to koloss and questioning Yomen’s trust in his people. Elend annoys Yomen, drawing out the confrontation and sowing doubt.

Elend hopes Vin can now act to end the conflict before it truly begins.
