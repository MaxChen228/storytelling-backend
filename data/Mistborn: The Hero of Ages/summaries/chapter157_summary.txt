Sazed contemplates the number sixteen, Preservation's ancient sign to mankind, left as unalterable clues hinting at unnatural events and hidden help. He still investigates its deeper ramifications. Discussing with the First Generation, Sazed confirms Ruin subtly altered prophecies to emphasize Vin as the Hero, hoping she would free him. He notes the original prophecies used gender-neutral terms, intentionally obscuring the Hero's identity, and worries about Vin's lack of power now that the Well of Ascension is depleted.

The ancient Terrismen reveal that Ruin and Preservation created the world together. Preservation, desiring life with emotion, made a deal: Ruin would help create men, but at the cost of one day being allowed to destroy the world. Preservation then sacrificed himself to imprison Ruin, preventing immediate destruction. Sazed struggles with this narrative, finding it too similar to common mythological clichés, challenging his scholarly search for unique truth against the need for faith. He learns the Well's power was a concentrated part of Preservation's pervasive influence, while Ruin was the equally powerful, imprisoned force of dark smoke.

Sazed grapples with the kandra's assertion that faith, not logic, is key to understanding, but he resolves to gather more facts about their religion before making a final judgment.
