The Lord Ruler suppressed all technological progress for a millennium, a static reign that eventually collapsed. Sazed recalls how the Lord Ruler's ban on city walls once hinted at his vulnerability, fueling his own rebellion.

Now, Sazed, Breeze, Allrianne, and Captain Goradel enter Urteau, a city rebellious against all nobles, including Elend. Goradel fears the city's brutality, but Breeze calls them expendable ambassadors. They observe Urteau's unique canal-trough roads, making buildings seem unnaturally tall.

Urteau soldiers greet them, and the "Citizen" king demands an immediate meeting.
