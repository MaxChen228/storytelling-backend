Elend announces the army will march on Fadrex City, driven by the discovery of a new cache that might contain crucial resources, possibly even atium. Cett, eager for conquest and to spite rival kings, celebrates the decision. Vin senses the importance of atium, believing it must be there. A sudden earthquake briefly shakes the camp, a reminder of the world's instability, and Elend acknowledges the growing concerns about the ash, mists, and quakes.

The discussion turns to conquering Fadrex. Elend, hardened by war but still morally conflicted, insists on attempting diplomacy first, despite Cett's pragmatic view that war requires killing. Ham raises concerns about the city's strong defenses. Elend and Cett, combining their strategic minds, agree on a siege if diplomacy fails, planning to cut off supplies and outlast the city, even considering using koloss as a last resort.

Sazed interjects, highlighting a critical overlooked factor: Fadrex lies beyond the mist perimeter, posing a significant threat to the army. Elend, acknowledging the hypocrisy of protecting his soldiers while villagers suffered, resolves that the army must also face the mists and immunize themselves. The journey to Fadrex will test their resolve against both human and environmental threats.
