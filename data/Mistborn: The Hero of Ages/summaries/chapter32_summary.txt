Feverish and wounded, Spook's mind drifts, recalling Kelsier's early, confusing talk of a mysterious "Eleventh Metal" and his secretive past in "the West." His thoughts then turn to a more personal memory: his own childhood as a young skaa boy, Lestibournes, running with street gangs in the Eastern Lands.

His family captures him, fearing his unusual nature will attract the Lord Ruler's Inquisitors. To protect themselves, they decide to kill him. As they press down on his neck, a gnarled man—his uncle—arrives, offering copper coins for the boy. He threatens to expose the family if they refuse, revealing his mother, Margel, secretly sent for him.

Abandoned by his fearful family, Spook leaves with his uncle for Luthadel. As they depart, he chooses a new name: Lestibournes, street slang for "I've been abandoned." This marks the beginning of his journey, long before Kelsier renames him Spook. As Spook grapples with these painful memories, his present-day struggle against his wounds and the city's turmoil continues.
