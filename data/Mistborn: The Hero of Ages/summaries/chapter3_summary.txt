TenSoon faces judgment, serving a greater "First Contract" with Vin, the Heir of the Survivor, their Mother. KanPaar and the Second Generation dismiss this as blasphemy, but TenSoon warns Ruin has come, and the world faces the Resolution. He confesses his true betrayal: revealing the kandra's secret Flaw to Vin, allowing her to control him. He argues Vin, as their Mother, had a right to know, holding the key to their future.

Despite TenSoon's plea, the First Generation stays silent. KanPaar declares him guilty, sentencing him in one month. Though condemned, TenSoon's revelation about the Flaw and Vin's importance may yet inspire action among his people.
