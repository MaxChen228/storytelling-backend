Preservation once sacrificed most of his consciousness to imprison Ruin, breaking their deal and leaving both powers nearly balanced but severely weakened. Their minds, however, remain independent of their raw power, their origins a mystery.

Elend slowly returns from a devastated village, leading his new koloss army. He grapples with immense guilt over the villagers' suffering and the harsh necessities of war, including using koloss to besiege Luthadel. He envies Vin's incredible abilities, even as he now possesses similar powers, but his deepest fear is for her capture. The world around him deteriorates rapidly; ashfall intensifies, burying the landscape and threatening to suffocate all life. Elend feels a crushing weight, realizing he has always relied on Vin to solve the impossible, seeing her as an almost divine force of instinct. He questions their entire struggle, succumbing to a profound despair that everything they've done is pointless, unable to protect the people he loves.

Alone in the deepening ash and mists, Elend finally gives up hope, believing their doom is inevitable. As he kneels, a mysterious creature of mist suddenly appears beside him, hinting at an unexpected intervention.
