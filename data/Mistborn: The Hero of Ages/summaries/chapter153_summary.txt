Sazed confronts KanPaar, revealing that only the Terris religion survived and foretells this exact day, implying its truth. He presents a book on the Hero of Ages, admitting Ruin corrupted its text. Sazed proposes they compare his "lies" with KanPaar's "truths" to discern Ruin's plan.

Before KanPaar can respond, unseen voices dismiss the Second Generation kandra. Ancient First Generation kandra enter, their translucent flesh revealing original human bones. Sazed learns they retained these bones, lacking the skill for True Bodies. He prepares to begin their crucial work.
