Spook, realizing Kelsier's voice manipulated him, rips a steel shard from his chest, severing the influence and losing his pewter Allomancy. Overwhelmed, he collapses, but tin-enhanced senses bring lucidity. Sazed arrives, confirming the city burns. Haunted by past failures, Spook refuses to abandon Urteau, determined to save it. He proposes using the canals, but Beldre confesses she attacked the guards, preventing the floodgates from opening.

Spook confronts a dazed Quellion, forcing him to lead the people in forming fire brigades, threatening his life if he refuses. Spook then sets off to the cache to release the waters himself, joined by Sazed and Beldre. Beldre admits her betrayal, explaining her need to protect her brother, and hints at a mysterious "interference" affecting them both.

Reaching the Ministry building, they find the cache engulfed in an inferno, too hot to approach. Spook, despairing, feels he has failed the city, but Sazed reassures him. With their primary plan thwarted and the city burning, they must now find another way to bring water and quell the raging fires.
