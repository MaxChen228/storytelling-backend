Controlled by Ruin, Marsh attacks King Penrod, feigning a struggle. He carefully wounds the king, letting guards believe it's an even fight. On Ruin's command, Marsh plunges a hidden spike directly into Penrod's heart, then escapes through a window.

Marsh later overhears surgeons who believe the spike only came "dangerously close" to Penrod's heart, as the king feels surprisingly well. They decide to leave the spike in place. Ruin's clever plan is to subtly influence Penrod, making him a pawn, unaware of the spike's true purpose. Penrod will soon forget the spike is even there.
