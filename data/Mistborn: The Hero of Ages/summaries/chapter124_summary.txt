Imprisoned, Vin constantly hears Ruin's voice urging her to kill. She questions her sanity but learns about Ruin's nature and influence. She realizes she still controls distant koloss, considering their use, but complex commands are difficult, and she fears revealing this tool.

Ruin appears in Reen's form, taunting Vin for her inaction compared to her past escape from the Lord Ruler. He declares everyone, including Elend, his tool, asserting that fighting him only furthers his inevitable goal of ending all things. He dismisses morality, claiming all men serve his purpose as the "caretaker" of universal decay.

Ruin's gloating and display of human emotions—pride and victory—spark a crucial realization in Vin. She perceives humanity in him, making him vulnerable to manipulation and deception, much like Kelsier understood the Lord Ruler. As an earthquake shakes the cell and Ruin revels, Vin now believes she can defeat him, but the clock is ticking.
