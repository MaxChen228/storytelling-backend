Spook parts ways with Breeze, who heads to a reputable tavern, while Spook ventures into the poorer Harrows. Breeze, despite his disguise, refuses to get dirty, prompting Spook's playful jab. Empowered by pewter, Spook feels exhilarated, leaping through streets with newfound strength and grace, heading to Durn, an underworld figure, to confront rumors of Spook's death and Kelsier connection.

Arriving at Durn's fortified hideout, Spook uses pewter to shatter the door, stunning the guards and Durn. Spook demands answers. Durn reveals he knew Spook from his distinctive eyes and Kelsier association, explaining that news travels. He admits spreading rumors of Spook's death at Quellion's hands, not out of malice, but to rally public sentiment against the Citizen.

Durn explains Quellion's rule is disastrous for business, making him an underworld enemy. He offers Spook's group full support if they challenge Quellion, emphasizing many share his desire for change. This unexpected alliance could prove crucial in the looming conflict.
