Vin fights desperately against thirteen Inquisitors, her Allomantic reserves straining. She kicks, Pulls, and dodges, even impaling one foe on a spire during a desperate fall, but loses her weapon. More Inquisitors close in. With a final, powerful duralumin-enhanced burst, she throws them back, but the effort drains her pewter, leaving her injured and vulnerable on the cobblestones. Ruin's voice whispers in her mind, demanding atium and claiming each blow helps him.

Marsh, silent and menacing, confronts her. Vin, bleeding and in pain, clings to a desperate plan: to push herself to the brink, hoping the mists will intervene as they have before. But as Marsh begins his brutal assault, shattering her leg and then her arms, Vin screams, reaching for the mists in vain. They remain aloof, abandoning her in her greatest need, leaving her alone and tortured, no longer the powerful Mistborn she once was. Marsh's spiked eyes are unreadable as he continues his work, hinting at the depths of interrogation and suffering yet to come.
