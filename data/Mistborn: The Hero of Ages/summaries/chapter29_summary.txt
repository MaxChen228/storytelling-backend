Vin watches Elend’s desperate army hold against the koloss, realizing the creatures’ fear makes them vulnerable. She begins to burn brass, mentally seizing control of individual koloss and turning them against their own. Soon, chaos erupts as Vin creates a small army of converted koloss, a tactic Elend quickly adopts, further disrupting the enemy ranks.

Suddenly, a Steel Inquisitor descends, a terrifying, spike-eyed foe Vin doesn't recognize. Memories of Kelsier’s death and her own captivity flood her mind as she burns electrum, preparing for a brutal fight. The Inquisitor, wielding obsidian axes, proves formidable. Vin discovers its critical weakness—a dorsal spike—is protected by a metal shield, making a quick kill impossible.

Wounded, Vin struggles to find another way to defeat the powerful Inquisitor. She dodges its relentless attacks, her own glass dagger proving insufficient against its armored form. The fight is desperate, a dance of death amidst the ash and blood. Something flashes in the air, hinting at an unexpected turn.
