The author confesses an unresolved plot point, deliberately left open to ensure the series' continuation, despite their usual neat endings. This sets a meta-narrative hook for future developments.

Young mathematician Gaal Dornick travels from Synnax to Trantor, the magnificent capital of the Galactic Empire, which now rules twenty-five million planets. This era marks the last half-century of the Empire's undisputed dominance. Gaal, with a fresh doctorate, arrives by invitation from the legendary Hari Seldon to join his mysterious Psychohistory Project. Seldon, a mathematical prodigy, has transformed psychohistory into a profound statistical science, capable of predicting the future on a galactic scale. Gaal's journey through hyper-space is uneventful, but his anticipation to see Trantor from orbit is thwarted, leaving him with a childish disappointment.

Upon landing, Gaal is immediately overwhelmed by Trantor's immense scale and bustling activity. The air feels thicker, gravity heavier, and the debarkation hall stretches into a hazy distance, making him question if he can ever adapt to such immensity. He now stands at the threshold of the Seldon Project, ready to face its secrets.
