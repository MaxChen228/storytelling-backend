Mallow confronts a skeptical tech-man, offering a gift the Emperor lacks. He demonstrates a personal force-shield by allowing the tech-man to shoot him, the blast harmlessly dissipating. Mallow then gives the tech-man a similar shield, powered by a tiny, hidden nuclear generator, despite the tech-man's disbelief. In exchange, Mallow demands to inspect the tech-man's vital power generators, observing his complacent pride in their supposed "eternity" and complete control. After Mallow leaves, the tech-man's new shield mysteriously fails, highlighting Mallow's superior technological understanding.

Back on Terminus, Mallow reveals his true ambition to Ankor Jael: he intends to secure a council seat. He enlists Jael's help, leveraging Jael's past political ousting by Jorane Sutt, Mallow's primary rival. Mallow, an outsider, acknowledges prejudice but asserts his financial backing and strategic depth.

Their conversation is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of Jorane Sutt. Mallow quickly instructs Jael to listen in. Sutt, wasting no time, immediately confronts Mallow, demanding to know what he did at Korell, indicating Mallow's recent activities are already under intense political scrutiny.
