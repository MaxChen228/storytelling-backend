Hardin strategically reveals Terminus's nuclear power to Anacreon's envoy, Haut Rodric, infuriating Pirenne. Hardin explains his calculated gamble: he suspects the Periphery has lost its nuclear technology, a suspicion confirmed by Rodric's ignorance about plutonium. This makes Terminus a perceived military threat, deterring Anacreon's true intention to parcel out the planet.

As mayor, Hardin forces his way onto the Foundation's Board of Trustees. Pirenne announces Lord Dorwin, the Imperial Chancellor, will visit, naively expecting the Empire to resolve the Anacreon problem. Hardin dismisses the distant Empire as powerless, revealing Terminus's "nuclear weapons" are a bluff, possessing only commercial nuclear power—a fact Anacreon will soon discover.

Hardin urgently advocates for militarization, but the Board, led by Pirenne, Crast, and Sutt, vehemently refuses, prioritizing the Encyclopedia above all else, even Terminus's million inhabitants. Hardin passionately argues their stagnant focus on old knowledge reflects the Galaxy's decline and loss of advanced technology. This fundamental clash between pragmatic survival and academic dogma foreshadows a critical struggle for Terminus's destiny.
