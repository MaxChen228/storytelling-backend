Consumed by rage, Wienis attempts to kill Mayor Salvor Hardin with a nuclear blast, but Hardin's force-field effortlessly neutralizes the attack. In despair, Wienis accidentally kills himself. Hardin returns to Terminus a hero, celebrated for his strategic victory over Anacreon and securing treaties that grant the Foundation unprecedented power. His popularity now rivals Hari Seldon's.

The Time Vault fills for Hari Seldon's second appearance. Anxious Yohan Lee worries, while opportunistic Actionists like Sef Sermak already plot aggressive expansion. Seldon appears, confirming the second crisis is overcome. He explains the Foundation's success through "Spiritual Power" against "Temporal Power," but warns against overconfidence, stating this power cannot be used for attack due to "Regionalism." The Foundation, he stresses, is only at the start, surrounded by powerful barbarian kingdoms and a still-formidable Galactic Empire, and a mysterious Second Foundation at Star's End awaits discovery.
