Mayor Hardin reveals the Anacreon treaty grants total independence, making Empire threats meaningless. He exposes Lord Dorwin, the Empire's diplomat, as a master of empty rhetoric, having recorded their five-day discussion, proving Dorwin said nothing of substance. This deception means the Foundation's threats, based on false Empire support, provoked Anacreon's ultimatum, leaving one week to act.

Hardin opposes both passive acceptance and violence, calling the latter "the last refuge of the incompetent." He warns Anacreon seeks outright annexation. Board member Fulham expresses concern over Hardin's growing influence, emphasizing the Board's principle: protecting the Encyclopedia. Jord Fara then reveals the Board's decision to wait, stating the solution lies in what the Vault will reveal in six days.

Hardin challenges this blind faith, questioning Seldon's prescience in placing them on Terminus or delaying warnings. He criticizes the Board's "diseased attitude" of deferring to past authority—the Empire or Seldon—instead of independent thought, a pattern he sees throughout the Galaxy. The Foundation now faces a critical choice: trust Seldon's unseen plan or forge their own path.
