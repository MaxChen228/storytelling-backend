Gaal observes the trial of Hari Seldon before the scarlet-clad Commission of Public Safety. The Advocate questions Seldon about his project's size, revealing it involves nearly 100,000 individuals, far exceeding his initial claim of 50 mathematicians. Seldon confirms his prediction that Trantor will fall into ruin within three centuries, asserting this is a scientific truth derived from psychohistory, not disloyalty.

The Advocate presses Seldon, suggesting his predictions aim to destabilize the Empire and that his large group is an army. Seldon refutes this, explaining that while the future can be changed, the Empire's psychohistoric inertia is too vast for 100,000 people to prevent its collapse. Cornered, Seldon reveals his project's true purpose: to minimize the effects of the inevitable destruction.

He dramatically declares that Trantor's ruin is merely a symptom of the accelerating decline and fall of the entire Galactic Empire. This sparks outrage and cries of treason. Seldon calmly defends his mathematical prediction, comparing the seemingly strong Empire to a "rotten tree-trunk" already creaking under the storm of decay, destined to break.
