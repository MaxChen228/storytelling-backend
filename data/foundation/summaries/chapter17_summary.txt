Mayor Hardin defends his thirty-year strategy of offering science as "magic" to barbarian kingdoms, making Terminus invaluable and preventing war. He dismisses Sermak and a deputation criticizing the "mummery" and priesthood, arguing it was necessary for acceptance and that true scientific understanding remains beyond the priests' empirical grasp. A coded message from Yohan Lee signals brewing trouble, though Hardin asserts the government knows its business.

After the deputation leaves, Hardin and Lee discuss Sermak's growing political influence. Lee worries Sermak might not wait for an election, but Hardin reveals Sermak and his followers are under surveillance. Hardin then mentions Ambassador Poly Verisof's urgent return from Anacreon, hinting "things are breaking already." Lee expresses unease with Hardin's secretive methods, but the Mayor remains confident.

Meanwhile, Ambassador Verisof, high priest to Anacreon's people and ambassador to its king, secretly returns to Terminus. Disguised as a civilian, he uses Hardin's "obvious" strategy to avoid recognition. He recounts an encounter with a priest viewing advanced technology as "Holy Food," confirming the deep roots of the "religion of science." He reflects how science, once failed, re-established itself through this religious guise. The stage is set for a confrontation as internal political maneuvering and external imperial pressures converge on the Foundation.
