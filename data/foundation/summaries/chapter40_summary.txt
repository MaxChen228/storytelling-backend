Foundation official Sutt confronts Master Trader Hober Mallow about his sudden wealth, implying illicit gains. Mallow reveals his fortune is legitimate, earned through trade with the Commdor for raw materials, legally keeping half. He dismisses Sutt's concerns, asserting his right as a free agent to open new markets and adhere to law.

Sutt condemns Mallow for not spreading the Foundation's religion, arguing his "trade for its own sake" undermines the Seldon Plan and spiritual control. Mallow counters, calling the religious policy "outdated, dangerous, and impossible," citing its failures and the widespread hatred of Foundation priests. He advocates for "sincere friendship through trade" over an "insecure overlordship" based on a despised spiritual power.

Sutt attempts to bribe Mallow, then threatens him with a twenty-year prison term and a murder trial for abandoning an Anacreonian priest to death. Sutt, preferring Mallow as a "destroyed enemy," gives him five seconds to prevent the charges. Mallow, unyielding, accepts. Ankor Jael later suggests Sutt's religious policy is bankrupt and uncontrollable, hinting at deeper, unspiritual motives.
