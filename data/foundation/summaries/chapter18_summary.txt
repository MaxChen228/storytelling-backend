Mayor Hardin presses Ambassador Verisof for an Anacreon update. Verisof portrays Prince Regent Wienis as a dangerous, ambitious fool, eager to attack the Foundation. Wienis, whose family saw a suspicious royal death, commands a strong navy. He found a derelict Imperial battle cruiser, demanding Foundation repair for his fleet and threatening war if refused. Verisof fears Wienis's impulsiveness and the cruiser's immense power, which could double Anacreon's navy. Hardin, surprisingly, decides to repair and gift the cruiser to Wienis, suggesting a renaming. He believes this appeasement buys time, trusting the Seldon Plan to prevent war. Verisof, concerned, also warns Hardin about a strong new political party forming on Terminus, urging immediate action against Anacreon or revealing the Plan, questioning Hardin's passive strategy.

Hardin firmly rejects premature action, explaining the Seldon Plan dictates a single course of action during a crisis. Deviating now would jeopardize everything. He reveals a worrying detail: six individuals now know about the Plan, a deviation he fears Seldon never intended.

As the Imperial cruiser is prepared for Wienis, the Foundation's fate rests on Hardin's unwavering faith in Seldon's unseen hand.
