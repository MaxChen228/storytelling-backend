Lord Dorwin, an Imperial dignitary, presents his archaeological theory that humanity originated on Arcturus III, predating space travel. He champions a "scientific method" based solely on analyzing ancient texts, dismissing firsthand research as crude. Salvor Hardin subtly challenges Dorwin's academic detachment, probing him about a recent power plant meltdown on Gamma Andromeda V and the decline of the Periphery planets, which have lost nuclear power. Dorwin remains indifferent, viewing these "barbarous" worlds as insignificant and firmly under Imperial sovereignty, despite their growing autonomy. His dismissive attitude highlights the Empire's decaying grasp on reality and technology.

Hardin, increasingly sidelined from Board meetings, soon faces a direct crisis. An ultimatum arrives from the King of Anacreon, demanding unspecified concessions within a week, or force will be used. Dr. Pirenne, Chairman of the Board, is distraught, having assured Anacreon of the Emperor's benevolent attitude based on Dorwin's assurances. Hardin reveals Pirenne's diplomatic blunder likely provoked the ultimatum.

Applying symbolic logic, Hardin analyzes both the ultimatum and a treaty signed by Dorwin on the Emperor's behalf. He demonstrates that the ultimatum is a straightforward declaration of war, and the Empire's treaty with Anacreon is virtually meaningless. The Board members are stunned as Hardin exposes the Empire's hollow authority and the immediate, undeniable threat. The Foundation now faces a stark choice: comply or be conquered.
