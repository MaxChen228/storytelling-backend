Mallow confronts missionary Jord Parma, who is illegally in Korellian territory, defying both Korellian and Foundation law with spiritual fervor. As a hostile mob demands Parma's surrender, Mallow asserts his authority, drawing a blaster on Twer to ensure compliance. He agrees to release Parma, but only if the Korellian governor approaches alone. Parma is taken, cursing Mallow as a traitor. Mallow later explains to a shaken Twer that the entire incident felt like a setup, a "test" designed to provoke the Foundation into an act of war by defending an illegal missionary. He suspects Parma was bait.

Mallow's suspicions are confirmed when a direct invitation arrives from Commdor Asper, suggesting they passed the test. Mallow meets Asper, who projects an image of a humble, peace-loving "man of the people," emphasizing Korell's republican ideals. However, Mallow keenly observes heavily armed guards and recently reinforced walls, betraying a more formidable reality beneath Asper's carefully crafted facade. Mallow begins to propose a policy of "Free Trade," appealing to Asper's self-proclaimed enlightened leadership.

The true nature of Korell's power and Asper's intentions remain veiled, hinting at a complex negotiation ahead.
