On Terminus, Levi Norast reveals Salvor Hardin's imminent departure for Anacreon. Actionist leaders Sermak and Tarki denounce this as treason, believing Hardin has sold them out, and Sermak vows to impeach him.

Hardin departs Terminus at dawn, dismissing Yohan Lee's worries about public perception. Lee reports Sermak's failed impeachment and the Actionists' angry walkout, accusing Hardin of betrayal. Hardin counters with a strategic deception: Lee must announce a new Hari Seldon recording on March 14th, hinting at a "successfully concluded crisis." This aims to confuse Actionists and buy time, as Hardin leaves Lee to manage the political fallout.

Hardin travels to Anacreon, first visiting other systems, and is struck by the kingdom's vastness and the immense challenge of the Foundation's mission. Arriving at Anacreon's capital, he finds the planet consumed by fervent religious pageantry for the young god-king Lepold's coronation. Hardin meets Ambassador Verisof briefly, then observes the festivities anonymously, wary of the religious duties he might face if recognized. As the coronation of the nuclear-powered god-king looms, Hardin remains an anonymous observer, poised for the unfolding crisis.
