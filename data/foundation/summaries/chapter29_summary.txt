Isolated and with Gorov held hostage, Ponyets unveils his nuclear transmuter to the skeptical Askonian Grand Master and council. Despite fears of "black-magic," Ponyets claims his device turns iron into pure gold, demonstrating with Randel's buckles. The council is stunned, but Pherl argues the gold is from a "poisoned source," an affront to their ancestors.

Ponyets counters that gold is gold, and its pious use for ancestral shrines would purify any perceived evil, especially if it saves a "heathen" life. To allay fears, he proposes a 30-day trial: the gold and he will be held hostage, proving acceptance if no divine displeasure occurs. The council, swayed by Ponyets' logic and the promise of gold, agrees, even Pherl.

A week later, Ponyets meets Pherl privately. Pherl questions Ponyets' "clumsy" public demonstration, but Ponyets reveals it was a deliberate tactic to attract Pherl's attention. He hints at a deeper game, observing Pherl's youth and non-Five Tribes origin, suggesting a vulnerability Ponyets intends to exploit. Ponyets prepares to leverage Pherl's unique position.
