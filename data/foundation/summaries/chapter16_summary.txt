Mayor Hardin meets with young, ambitious Councilman Sef Sermak and his colleagues. Sermak, a rising political star, immediately challenges Hardin's foreign policy, accusing him of appeasement. He argues Hardin's administration has stripped Terminus of its defenses by providing nuclear aid to the Four Kingdoms, making the planet vulnerable to their increasing demands. Sermak asserts he speaks for the dissatisfied people of Terminus.

Sermak delivers an ultimatum: Hardin must resign, or a new political party will oust him. Sermak advocates Terminus cease "bribes," strengthen itself, and "attack first." Hardin dismisses violence as "the last refuge of the incompetent," recounting how he removed an Anacreonian military base from Terminus without conflict, by turning other kingdoms against Anacreon, demonstrating strategic diplomacy.

Hardin explains the Four Kingdoms remain a constant threat, each desiring nuclear power, kept at bay only by mutual fear. He argues Terminus's survival depends on maintaining this delicate balance. Sermak remains convinced Hardin's policies demand aggressive action. A political showdown looms as Terminus grapples with rising external threats and internal dissent.
