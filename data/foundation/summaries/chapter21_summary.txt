Lewis Bort, a key figure in the dissident Action Party, returns from Anacreon with grim news, declaring their cause a "Lost Cause." He explains to Sermak and the others that the Foundation's established religion on Anacreon has made any internal rebellion impossible.

This religion, actively fostered by the Foundation, operates on strict authoritarian lines. The priesthood controls scientific instruments empirically, while the king is revered as a minor god, an absolute monarch by divine right. Bort reveals the Foundation uses scientific "tricks" to create a divine aura around the king, allowing him to appear to levitate or emit light, solidifying this belief. Sermak struggles to comprehend why Salvor Hardin would implement a system that so thoroughly entrenches the monarchy and prevents internal opposition, especially while arming Anacreon.

Sermak finds Hardin's contradictory actions "fishy," refusing to believe he is a fool or a traitor. He questions rumors of the Foundation refurbishing an old Imperial battle cruiser for Anacreon's navy, a detail Hardin's spokesmen never denied. Bort warns that with King Lepold's coming of age next week, the god-king can command his people to war at any moment.
