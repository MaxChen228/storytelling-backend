Priest-attendant Aporat curses the flagship *Wienis* in the Galactic Spirit's name. Instantly, the ship dies, plunging into darkness and silence, terrifying the soldiers. Aporat seizes control, leading the fearful crew. He confronts Prince Lefkin, who rages against Aporat's "treason," but soldiers quickly subdue him.

Aporat then forces a beaten Lefkin to broadcast a message to the Anacreonian fleet and Regent Wienis. Lefkin declares the navy is returning, refusing sacrilege against the Foundation. He issues an ultimatum: cease war against the true faith, guarantee no future aggression, and imprison Wienis for his crimes, or the navy will destroy the palace.

In Wienis's chambers, Salvor Hardin observes the regent's shock. Hardin reveals the Foundation's true power: the "religion of science" is a deliberate tool to control the Four Kingdoms. Nuclear power, held by the Foundation-loyal priesthood, bridles the kings. Wienis, realizing his defeat, hysterically orders his soldiers to shoot Hardin, but the faith-bound soldiers refuse, leaving Hardin unharmed and Wienis powerless. Wienis's desperate rage suggests his defeat might not be entirely final.
