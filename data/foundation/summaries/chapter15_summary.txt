Hari Seldon's recorded image reveals the Foundation's true purpose: not an encyclopedia, but a psychohistorical plan to shorten the Galactic Empire's inevitable 30,000-year barbarism to just one millennium. He explains that the Foundation has been maneuvered into a series of crises, each limiting their freedom of action to ensure this path. The current crisis sees Terminus, an isolated world of scientists with nuclear power but no metals, threatened by barbarian neighbors. Seldon declares the solution "obvious," foreshadowing the rise of a Second Empire. Salvor Hardin, having anticipated the fraud, takes control, confirming the Board's powerlessness and preparing for the Anacreonians, knowing the solution is clear.

Thirty years later, Mayor Salvor Hardin, now 62, reflects on the Empire's decline and the rise of petty "Four Kingdoms" from its former provinces. Terminus remains an island of science, preserving knowledge amidst fading nuclear power. Hardin and his trusted aide, Yohan Lee, anticipate a deputation from these kingdoms. Lee advocates for a direct confrontation, but Hardin, ever the strategist, prefers a more subtle approach, emphasizing the "gentle art of sneaking up from behind." He prepares to meet the young, dangerous Sermak and his delegation with flattery and careful maneuvering.

The stage is set for Hardin to navigate this new political landscape, hinting at the complex power plays that will define the Foundation's early years.
