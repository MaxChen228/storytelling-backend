Jael warns Hober Mallow that Jorane Sutt plans to weaponize religion against the Foundation, mobilizing subject planets to declare Mallow a heretic and seize power. Mallow admits to having a priest lynched, a legally justified act given the priest's illegal presence. Jael cautions that Sutt aims to destroy Mallow's public standing, not legally convict him; an acquittal would still brand Mallow a "cowardly dog," costing him popularity and influence.

On the day of his trial, the council chamber and public squares are packed with a hostile crowd, fueled by "lynch talk" and Publis Manlio's incitement as both Foreign Secretary and High Priest. Mallow, defiant, begins his defense by admitting the prosecution's account of the priest incident is accurate but incomplete. He then reveals his initial suspicions about Jorane Sutt and Jaim Twer.

Mallow explains that Twer, posing as a retired trader, was suspiciously ignorant of Seldon crises, exposing him as a priest and a spy for Sutt. Knowing Twer was a spy, Mallow strategically invited him on his voyage, preferring a known enemy. This revelation exposes Twer as a paid operative, not a reluctant witness, and hints at a crucial, unmentioned action Mallow took during the priest's first appearance. Listeners will soon discover the full extent of Mallow's calculated counter-move.
