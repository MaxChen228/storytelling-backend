Mayor Hardin confronts the Board of Trustees, accusing them of myopic focus on the Encyclopedia while the galaxy decays and nuclear power is lost. He insists they fail to grasp the true, larger problem Hari Seldon foresaw, suggesting Seldon deliberately excluded top psychologists to prevent early discovery of his real plan. Hardin then meets with Yohan Lee, finalizing plans for a coup. He believes the Board's rigid adherence to imperial authority makes them incapable of recognizing a revolt, making them easy to depose. Despite his outward confidence, Hardin privately admits his own uncertainty about Seldon's ultimate intentions, especially with Anacreon's invasion imminent.

The Board gathers in the Vault, awaiting a pre-programmed message. As the lights dim, a holographic projection of Hari Seldon appears, confined to a wheelchair. Seldon calmly announces that the Encyclopedia Foundation is, and always has been, a "fraud." He explains it served merely as a means to secure an imperial charter, attract a large population, and keep them preoccupied for fifty years. Now, with their retreat cut off, the Foundation members have no choice but to proceed with the infinitely more important, real plan.
