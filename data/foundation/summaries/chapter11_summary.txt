The chapter opens with a council member declaring the Galactic Empire is dying, a statement quickly dismissed. Jord Fara shifts focus, reminding everyone of the Foundation's upcoming 50th anniversary and the opening of Hari Seldon's mysterious Vault. Fara posits Seldon, a master psychologist, would have used his science to predict future dangers and provide solutions within the Vault, not merely a ceremonial message. This idea deeply intrigues Salvor Hardin, a former psychology student, who begins to grasp that Seldon's psychohistory holds the key to understanding their predicament and predicting the future.

Hardin then seeks Lord Dorwin, the Imperial Chancellor, finding him with Pirenne. Dorwin, arrogant and dismissive, praises the Encyclopedia but largely ignores the "barbarous" Periphery and the growing Anacreonian threat. Hardin dryly points out Anacreon's capacity for warfare, a warning Dorwin brushes aside, more interested in archaeology and the "Origin Question"—humanity's original homeworld. He is particularly excited about an ancient text, Lameth, and asks Pirenne to make him a copy, seemingly oblivious to immediate crises.

The Vault's opening promises revelations that will challenge the Foundation's future and Dorwin's priorities.
