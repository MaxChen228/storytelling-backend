Regent Wienis informs his nephew, Lepold, that he will soon be king of Anacreon and must prepare for war against the Foundation. Wienis manipulates Lepold, portraying the Foundation as an oppressive power hoarding technology, seeking galactic rule, and having humiliated Lepold's grandfather. He convinces the young king that striking first is self-defense, promising that seizing Foundation power will secure Anacreon's galactic dominion. Lepold, initially timid, grows excited by the prospect of revenge and immense power. Wienis reveals they must await battle cruiser repairs and the arrival of Salvor Hardin, the Foundation's leader. Lepold expresses fear of Hardin and hesitation about attacking, citing the "Galactic Spirit," but Wienis dismisses this as mummery, explaining it's a tool for obedience, making Lepold a "semi-divine" king, and promises an empire far grander than any "Galactic Paradise."

As their conversation ends, Wienis issues a chilling, veiled warning about "accidents" during Nyak hunts, subtly reminding Lepold of his father's death and his own precarious position. Lepold, though outwardly agreeing, leaves with a growing sense of unease, questioning his uncle's true motives and realizing Wienis and his sons are next in line for the throne.

The stage is set for a confrontation with Salvor Hardin, but Lepold now faces a deeper, more personal threat.
