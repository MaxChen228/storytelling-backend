Sutt informs Manlio the Foundation faces its third Seldon crisis: an external nuclear threat and internal political struggle. He explains Seldon's psychohistory predicted these moments to guide the Foundation toward rebuilding the Empire. Sutt identifies powerful, independent traders as the internal threat, fearing their secular influence could cause outer provinces to secede. He tasks Manlio with curbing their power, hinting at Manlio's political rise if successful, as Sutt lacks authority and the Mayor evades responsibility.

Concurrently, trader Hober Mallow meets Jaim Twer, who urges him to run for council, championing trader rights during a political party split. Mallow initially refuses, citing a secret mission orchestrated by Sutt. Twer suspects Sutt is sidelining Mallow, but Mallow, aware of the impending Seldon crisis, believes Sutt's maneuver might inadvertently benefit them. He educates Twer on the Seldon Plan and its pre-ordained crises, confirming their predicament.

With no definite strategy but a resolve to "improvise," Mallow invites Twer on a mysterious journey towards the Whassallian Rift. Listeners can anticipate Mallow's direct engagement with the crisis as he ventures into the unknown.
