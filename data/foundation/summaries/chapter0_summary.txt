From original chapter1 summary:
In August 1941, Isaac Asimov, 21, needs a story for editor Campbell, finding inspiration. Randomly opening a book, he free-associates from soldiers to empires, conceiving a Galactic Empire's fall, inspired by Gibbon. With Campbell, he develops a vast series detailing a thousand-year interregnum between two Empires, guided by psychohistory.

Asimov begins "Foundation," introducing Hari Seldon, who establishes two Foundations to shorten humanity's dark age from 30,000 to 1,000 years. A cliffhanger secures Campbell's commitment. Despite early challenges, Asimov continues, producing his favorite, "The Mule." Years later, Asimov tries to end the saga, but Campbell demands more, resulting in "-And Now You Don't," his final story.

Though Asimov believes the series complete, Gnome Press publishes *The Foundation Trilogy*, persuading him to write an introduction. Initial distribution struggles. In 1961, Doubleday's Timothy Seldes secures rights. From then, *Foundation* achieves widespread success and acclaim, becoming a science fiction landmark. Listeners can now anticipate delving into this pivotal saga.


From original chapter2 summary:
In 1966, the Foundation series unexpectedly wins a special Hugo Award for best all-time series, a triumph the author feels should be glory enough. However, readers and editors relentlessly demand he "finish" the series, which only covers 300 of a projected thousand-year hiatus. The author, having shifted to non-fiction, finds these demands irritating and is no longer in a "Foundation-writing mood."

Despite his reluctance, persistent nudging from friends like Lester del Rey, who even offers to write it himself, keeps the idea alive. Finally, in 1981, Doubleday editor Betty Prashker forces the issue, offering a staggering $50,000 advance for a new Foundation novel. The author initially resists the large obligation but ultimately signs the contract.

He rereads the original trilogy after thirty years, feeling uneasy about its lack of physical action. Reassurance comes from critic James Gunn, who highlights the series' success in "permutations and reversals of ideas." Reinvigorated, the author resumes writing, incorporating modern scientific concepts and aiming for a unified, longer narrative. He completes the manuscript, now titled "Foundations at Bay," by March 1982. Listeners can anticipate a new Foundation story, rich in ideas, whose plot remains a tantalizing secret.
