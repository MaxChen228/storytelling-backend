Hardin meets Prince Regent Wienis privately. Ambitious Wienis outlines Anacreon's plan to reunite the Galaxy using Foundation aid. Hardin states the Foundation is impartial, but Wienis, a "direct action" believer, admits coercing their help with war threats. Hardin subtly challenges Wienis's motives, hinting at his designs on the throne, angering the Regent.

Wienis declares Hardin his prisoner, surrounded by guards. He reveals Hardin's "error": leaving Terminus undefended while helping Anacreon build an "irresistible" navy. Wienis announces his fleet launched 50 minutes ago, set to attack Terminus at noon tomorrow with nuclear blasts. Hardin, a prisoner, expresses disappointment, not at his capture, but at Wienis's timing.

Hardin calmly reveals his "counterstroke" was set for midnight. At that moment, Anacreon goes under "interdict": all priests strike, declaring the attack on the Foundation sacrilege. Mobs are already forming, incited by priests, turning public opinion against Wienis. Wienis is visibly shaken as Hardin, unconcerned, advises him to witness the unfolding chaos. The fate of Wienis's military campaign now rests on the immediate impact of Hardin's religious gambit.
