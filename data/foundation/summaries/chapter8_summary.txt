Lewis Pirenne, head of the Encyclopedia Foundation, meticulously oversees the final preparations for the Encyclopedia Galactica's first volume, due for publication in five years. He dismisses the interruption from Salvor Hardin, Mayor of Terminus City, who brings alarming news: the Royal Governor of Anacreon has declared himself king, severing Terminus's vital trade routes for metals. Hardin urges Pirenne and the Foundation's Board of Trustees to act, as they hold administrative power. Pirenne, however, rigidly adheres to the Foundation's scientific mandate, refusing to engage in "local politics" and confidently asserting that the Empire will protect them. He scoffs at Hardin's doubts about the Empire's weakening grip on its peripheral prefects and chides him for his newspaper's plans for public celebrations, stating the upcoming Vault opening is for the Board alone. Hardin then reveals Anacreon is sending a special envoy to Terminus.

Two weeks later, Anselm haut Rodric, Anacreon's envoy, arrives, met by Mayor Hardin with formal ceremony. Rodric keenly observes Terminus, questioning its unique social structure—its lack of exploited land, estates, peasantry, or nobility. His inquiries hint at Anacreon's imperialistic intentions, assessing the planet's vulnerabilities and potential for control.

Listeners should anticipate a direct confrontation between the Foundation's scientific ideals and the encroaching political realities of a fracturing Empire.
