Hardin explains Seldon's Plan operates on blind mob psychology, not individual foresight, to prevent interference. He admits trying to avoid acting on his own prescience, fearing it could derail the path. The crisis is now inevitable: Regent Wienis will attack once the Foundation repairs Anacreon's battle cruiser, while a new, hostile Council on Terminus will force action against Anacreon. Hardin notes a slight timing discrepancy between these converging events, worrying his own foresight might be responsible. Despite the Plan's precision, he feels a growing unease, deciding he must be on Anacreon when the crisis breaks.

Meanwhile, on Anacreon, young King Lepold I, more interested in Nyak hunting than statecraft, is confronted by his uncle, Regent Wienis. Wienis scolds the naive king, asserting his dominance and dismissing Lepold's childish protests. Wienis reveals he has inspected the old Imperial cruiser the Foundation is repairing for Anacreon's navy. Lepold foolishly believes the Foundation's willingness to repair the ship proves they have no hostile intentions, confirming Wienis's low opinion of his nephew's judgment. Wienis's conciliatory words hide a steely resolve, as he prepares to discuss "affairs of state" with the king.

Listeners should anticipate the imminent confrontation as Hardin prepares to face the crisis on Anacreon, while Wienis readies his forces.
