Ponyets recounts how he blackmails Pherl. He secretly records Pherl operating the transmuter and crowing over his first piece of gold. Ponyets then shows Pherl the three-dimensional recording and threatens public exposure with a fake story of a recorder in the city square. Terrified, Pherl agrees to buy all their gadgets for tin, which Ponyets believes will make him the next Grand Master and a valuable asset. Gorov questions Ponyets' amoral sales technique, but Ponyets dismisses it, referencing Salvor Hardin's views on morals.

The narrative shifts to the rise of the Merchant Princes, introducing Hober Mallow. Jorane Sutt, the Mayor's secretary, meets with Master Trader Hober Mallow, revealing a potential Seldon crisis. Three nuclear-armed Foundation trade ships have vanished within the Korellian Republic, and Sutt suspects Korell has acquired nuclear weapons, possibly through treason. Sutt probes Mallow's loyalty by highlighting his Smyrnian (Outlander) origins, but Mallow fiercely defends his identity while denying any allegiance to the old regime.

Sutt clarifies that he needs Mallow, a skilled trader familiar with Korell, to travel there as an "eyes-open" merchant to uncover the source of Korell's newfound power. Mallow agrees to depart in six days. Later, Sutt and Foreign Secretary Publis Manlio discuss Mallow, with Manlio calling the mission a "crude stratagem" and questioning if Mallow, a capable man, will be easily duped. Listeners should anticipate Mallow's dangerous mission into Korellian territory and the unfolding mystery of the missing ships and Korell's power.
