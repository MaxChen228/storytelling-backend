Gaal questions Seldon about his psychohistory and the exile's truth. At the University, they face martial law and a six-month deadline for forced relocation to Terminus. Gaal is distraught, but Seldon calmly reveals this was planned.

In his secure office, Seldon explains he orchestrated the trial and exile, showing Gaal microfilms of two-and-a-half years of preparation. Terminus will be a scientific refuge, leveraging Imperial support to *force* twenty thousand families to the Galactic fringe.

Seldon reveals a second refuge at "Star's End" and announces his impending death. Successors, perhaps Gaal, continue the plan, instigating the Anacreon revolt. Seldon whispers, "I am finished." Listeners should anticipate the journey to Terminus and the establishment of the Foundation.
