Independent Traders, guided by Salvor Hardin's pragmatic motto, "Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right!", forge an enduring empire. Limmar Ponyets, a free-lance trader, receives a secret, self-destructing message: fellow trader Eskel Gorov is imprisoned on Askone, a closed world hostile to nuclear technology. Despite the danger, Ponyets feels compelled to go, knowing Gorov is actually a Foundation agent, making his rescue paramount.

Ponyets endures two weeks reaching Askone, navigating ancient warships and bureaucracy, unable to use force with Gorov a hostage. He confronts the Grand Master, a stern ruler despising nuclear technology. The Grand Master dismisses Ponyets' claims of unwitting trespass, revealing warnings of an "organized rescue campaign" and implying Gorov faces death. Ponyets argues for an alternative, his stomach knotting.

The Grand Master hints at a resolution, noting, "I have heard that the Foundation is rich." Ponyets begins to counter, emphasizing their wealth lies in the very nuclear goods Askone rejects, hinting at the complex economic leverage he must now employ.
