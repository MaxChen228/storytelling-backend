The Commdor of Korell resists Foundation trade, fearing it brings compulsory religion and loss of independence, citing Askone. He insists his people reject faith-bound commerce. Trader Hober Mallow counters, declaring money his sole religion, not mysticism, promising the only "catch" is immense riches, not spiritual subjugation.

Mallow demonstrates a dazzling, luminescent belt and necklace on a young girl, captivating her and the Commdor. He explains these luxury items, with short power units, ensure constant demand and 900% profit for the Commdor via controlled supply and dummy corporations. Mallow also offers advanced household gadgets and industrial retooling for steel foundries, promising drastically cut costs and shared profits, all without priestly supervision.

Swayed by wealth and popularity, the Commdor tentatively agrees to Mallow's terms, including payment in raw materials. He invites Mallow to dinner for further discussion, reiterating his strict "no religion" policy, which Mallow assures him would only cut profits. The Commdora, his sharp-tongued wife, expresses cynical disdain for her husband's decisions, anticipating the costly arrival of Mallow's men.
