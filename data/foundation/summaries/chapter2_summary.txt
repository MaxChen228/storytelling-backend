A mysterious figure follows Gaal as he navigates Trantor's complex, automated transport system. Overwhelmed, Gaal struggles to find a hotel, eventually receiving a glowing ticket and following a light trail to a taxi. He marvels at the enclosed flight through tunnels to the Luxor Hotel, noting the complete absence of sky.

Later, Gaal seeks an observation tower, hoping to see the "open air" of the planet-wide city. A room clerk, who admits he hasn't been outside in years, sells him a ticket. Gaal takes a gravitic elevator, momentarily disoriented by the zero-G, and is helped by a fellow passenger.

Stepping onto an open terrace, Gaal is met with a breathtaking panorama: an endless expanse of man-made structures stretching to a uniform gray sky. He sees no ground, no green, no natural life, only the colossal achievement of humanity's complete conquest of a world. Unbeknownst to him, this magnificent city, dependent on other planets for its very sustenance, harbors a critical vulnerability. What secrets does this vast, artificial world truly hold?
