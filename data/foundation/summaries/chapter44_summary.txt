Mallow dismisses Sutt's Viceroy concerns, offering him a choice: join his coalition or face jail. He reveals his strategy, born from his Korell and Empire visits: Seldon crises demand economic solutions, not heroics. His weapon is "trade without priests," a concept realized after observing Empire limitations.

Korell's economy relies heavily on Foundation nuclear tech. With trade stopped, gadgets fail – first household appliances, then factory machinery. Sutt doubts a "housewives' rebellion," but Mallow clarifies that widespread grumbling empowers ruined industrialists.

Sutt suggests Korell can get new tech from the Empire, but Mallow triumphantly counters. The Empire's technology is colossal, inefficient, and lacks the Foundation's miniaturized approach. The conflict is between the "big," outdated Empire and the "little," vital Foundation tech. This economic collapse will force Korell's hand.
