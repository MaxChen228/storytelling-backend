Gaal Dornick, a young mathematician, arrives on Trantor, initially captivated by its perceived glory. On an observation tower, he meets Jerril, who reveals Trantor's true nature: a vast, mostly subterranean world, powered by geothermal energy, where most inhabitants live entirely underground. Jerril subtly probes Gaal about his purpose, learning he's come to work with Hari Seldon. Jerril then reveals Seldon is known as "Raven" because he predicts disaster, hinting at the controversial nature of Seldon's work and the Empire's unease.

Returning to his room, Gaal finds Hari Seldon waiting. Seldon immediately reveals Jerril is a Public Safety agent, confirming the project is under investigation. With urgency, Seldon demonstrates psychohistory to Gaal using a calculator pad. He inputs complex data, projecting Trantor's future: total destruction within three centuries, with a 92.5% probability. Gaal grasps the terrifying implications: Trantor's specialization makes it vulnerable, and imperial instability will lead to its downfall.

Seldon explains these dire predictions are unprintable, but some results have leaked to the aristocracy, intensifying the investigation into his project. He emphasizes the critical need for speed. Gaal, now understanding the gravity, asks if Seldon himself is in danger.
