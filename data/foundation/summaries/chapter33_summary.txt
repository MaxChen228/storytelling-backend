Korell, a decaying world, struggles under Commdor Asper Argo, who fiercely prohibits Foundation influence. Hober Mallow's *Far Star* waits in a decrepit spaceport, its crew anxious after a week of unanswered requests. Mallow, however, sees "virgin territory" for trade. He explains to a worried Jaim Twer that Korell's apparent weakness—possibly lacking nuclear power—creates a precarious standoff. Mallow, though outnumbered, cannot afford to show vulnerability.

Suddenly, a Foundation missionary, Jord Parma, is let onto the ship against Mallow's strict orders. Furious, Mallow punishes the crew, asserting absolute authority. The injured, delirious Parma, claiming Foundation affiliation, begs for protection from "heathens." As Mallow interrogates him, an emergency alarm blares: "Enemy units in sight!" A vast Korellian mob now surrounds the *Far Star*. Mallow grimly orders Lieutenant Tinter to communicate with them, making no promises or threats. When Twer appeals to Mallow's honor to protect the priest, Mallow violently rebuffs him, declaring he will do as he pleases and threatening Twer's life if he interferes.

Mallow's ruthless pragmatism sets the stage for a dangerous confrontation.
