King Lepold's coronation is dramatically interrupted at midnight when his throne lifts, royal aura vanishes, and all palace lights fail. Regent Wienis, furious, orders flares, only to learn a mob led by High Priest Poly Verisof surrounds the palace, demanding Hardin's release and war cessation. Enraged, Wienis vows to blast any who approach, then drags a terrified Lepold to Hardin's chambers.

Inside, Hardin remains calm, revealing his masterful plan: a planet-wide shutdown orchestrated through the Foundation's priests. No power, water, heat, or communications function across Anacreon, save in the temples. Hardin coolly challenges Wienis to order priests back, knowing Wienis is powerless. Wienis, desperate, boasts his fleet, led by a cruiser Hardin repaired, is en route to attack the Foundation, giving Hardin until noon.

Hardin, smiling, reveals he *did* order the cruiser repaired, but "in his own way," hinting at a hyperwave relay. As a televisor flashes to life, High Priest Theo Aporat, aboard Wienis's flagship, acts. Loyal to the Foundation and horrified by the sacrilegious mission, Aporat uses the hyperwave relay he helped install, broadcasting to the entire ship. He declares the mission sacrilegious, removes Wienis's son from command in the Galactic Spirit's name, warning the crew of eternal damnation.

The fate of Wienis's fleet now hinges on the crew's response to this spiritual rebellion.
