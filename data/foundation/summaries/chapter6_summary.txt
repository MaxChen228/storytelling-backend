Dr. Hari Seldon confronts the Commission, asserting the Galactic Empire's inevitable fall and predicting 30,000 years of dark ages. His psychohistory, however, offers a way to shorten this interregnum to a single millennium by compiling an "Encyclopedia Galactica." This massive project, involving thirty thousand families, aims to preserve human knowledge for future generations. The initial trial adjourns, with Seldon expecting a private agreement.

Seldon and Gaal then meet privately with Linge Chen, the de facto Emperor. Chen dismisses Seldon's long-term concerns and threatens execution. Seldon counters with a chilling revelation: his death would not prevent the Fall but accelerate Trantor's collapse to fifty years and Chen's own demise within one, due to the psychological impact on the populace. This demonstrates Seldon's profound understanding of societal dynamics.

Chen offers Seldon a choice: death or exile to Terminus, a secluded, habitable planet at the Galaxy's edge, to continue the Encyclopedia. The public will be told Seldon is *preventing* the Fall, a deliberate deception. Seldon accepts the exile, bringing Gaal relief, yet a sense of Seldon's "defeat." This strategic relocation to the galactic periphery is crucial for Seldon's long-term plan, which is now set in motion.
