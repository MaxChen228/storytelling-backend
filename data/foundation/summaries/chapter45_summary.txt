Sutt confronts Hober Mallow, accusing him of treason and manipulating the Foundation into war, demanding his departure or facing a popular uprising fueled by the people's "consciousness of destiny." Mallow, unmoved, orders Sutt's arrest, dismissing him as a "blood-blind bull" who has lost judgment.

Jael fears Mallow has created a martyr and risks rebellion, but Mallow remains supremely confident. He explains his certainty in the Seldon Crisis's validity and the failure of religious control. Mallow now wields economic power, controlling all factories, trade, and shipping. He will ensure prosperity where his policies are accepted and collapse where Sutt's propaganda gains traction, believing people will always choose prosperity over revolt. He focuses only on the present crisis, leaving future challenges to successors.

The "unfought war" with Korell soon concludes with their unconditional surrender, solidifying Mallow's legacy.
