Pherl, ambitious for the Grand Mastership, rejects Ponyets' "evil little machines" (nucleics) due to public exposure risks. Ponyets instead offers a gold transmuter, emphasizing its secrecy and instant, untraceable wealth, a secure path to power for Pherl. Despite his cunning, Pherl demands Ponyets remain for a week as a guarantee, effectively trapping the trader.

After Gorov's release and the transmuter's delivery, Gorov contacts Ponyets, concerned this temporary device isn't the Foundation's true goal of openly promoting nuclear technology. Ponyets reveals the transmuter is a ruse, a "trick" to secure Gorov's freedom and his real profit: a massive, overpriced tin deal from Pherl's mining estates, necessary to meet his nucleics quota.

Ponyets explains Pherl believes he has him in a foolproof trap, able to denounce him for selling forbidden tech under patriotic pretenses. Anticipating Pherl's double-cross during the tin collection, Ponyets instructs Gorov to provide armed cover. A dangerous confrontation looms as Ponyets descends to Pherl's estates.
