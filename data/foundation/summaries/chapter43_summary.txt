Mallow reveals his controversial strategy to Jael: he will "do nothing" against Korell, despite anticipating war. He asserts the true threat is the Galactic Empire, which he believes is supplying Korell with advanced ships. On Korell, Commdor Asper Argo faces intense pressure from his ambitious wife, the Commdora. She manipulates him into declaring war on the Foundation, driven by her desire for her father's respect and influence within the Empire. The Commdor reluctantly agrees, though he secretly resents her and her father.

Soon after, a Foundation ship spots a massive Imperial vessel, confirming Mallow's fears. Two years into the war, Mallow, now Mayor, faces internal challenges. His Minister, Jael, warns him about Jorane Sutt, a "Religionist" who criticizes Mallow's "economic bribery and trade in gadgetry" policy. Sutt advocates for a return to the Foundation's traditional "conquest by missionary" approach, viewing Mallow's "do nothing" strategy as dangerous weakness.

Mallow confronts Sutt, who demands an aggressive offensive against Korell to project strength. Mallow, however, remains focused on the larger threat, asking Sutt how his plan would address the Empire. The stage is set for a clash of ideologies that will determine the Foundation's future.
