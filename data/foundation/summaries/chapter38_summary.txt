Old Barr confronts Mallow, revealing Mallow's arrival from the unguarded outer suns signals a new danger. Barr deduces Mallow possesses a unique, portable force-shield, linking him to ancient tales of "magicians" at the Galaxy's edge and speculating about a potential influx. He also shares that Siwenna's new viceroy harbors ambitions for the Imperial Crown or to forge a new empire in the barbarian hinterland, having even married a daughter to a Kinglet in the uncharted Periphery.

Mallow, seeking Siwenna's nuclear power generators, learns they are either military-controlled or managed by an unbribable, hereditary group of "tech-men." Barr, despite his cynicism, provides Mallow with a forged passport and advice, acknowledging Mallow's unique methods of "bribery." Mallow departs, leaving Barr provisions. He soon encounters a pompous tech-man who immediately suspects Mallow of attempting to bribe his way into the guild. The tech-man, fiercely proud and loyal, vehemently rejects Mallow's implied offer, threatening to report him.

Mallow faces a formidable obstacle in his quest, as the tech-man's unwavering loyalty and the city's strict controls present an immediate challenge to his plans.
