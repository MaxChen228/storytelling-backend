Mallow, confused and suspicious of a refugee missionary's sudden appearance, records the event. At his trial, the Visual Record plays: the missionary, a growing mob, and Jord Parma's appeal, ending with Mallow drawing his gun as the missionary is dragged away, emitting a tiny flash of light.

Mallow dissects the recording, highlighting inconsistencies: the missionary's and mob's sudden appearance, Parma's conspicuous attire. He argues Parma was a Korellian pawn, meant to provoke him. While the prosecution emphasizes Foundation honor, Mallow reveals their critical error: Jord Parma never existed. He was a Korellian Secret Police agent, identified by a KSP tattoo visible under UV light, part of an elaborate setup.

The chamber erupts as Mallow's accusers are exposed, and the crowd hails him as a hero. Seizing the moment, Mallow orders Ankor Jael to arrest Jorane Sutt and Publis Manlio for 'endangering the state,' to remove them. Mallow declares his intent to become mayor and high priest, believing it essential to confront an impending Seldon crisis.
