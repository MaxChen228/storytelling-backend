A large, armed stranger, Hober Mallow, enters the home of Onum Barr, a former Patrician of Siwenna. Mallow, claiming to be a trader, seeks the capital using outdated maps. Barr reveals Siwenna is no longer the capital, explaining political shifts and "rebellion and ruin." Mallow feigns concern for impoverished provinces, but Barr senses he is a fighting man. Barr bitterly denounces the current viceroy as a murderer and pillager, recounting Siwenna's tragic history: an Emperor's Admiral massacred the populace after a rebellion, then usurped power. Barr lost five sons and his daughter, surviving due to age.

Barr reveals his sixth son joined the viceroy's fleet under an assumed name, secretly planning the viceroy's execution. Mallow listens intently, his true intentions veiled, but his keen interest in the region's instability is undeniable. Listeners will soon discover the depth of Mallow's ambition in this fractured empire.
