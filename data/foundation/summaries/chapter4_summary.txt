Gaal Dornick's planned meeting with Hari Seldon is thwarted by his arrest from the Commission of Public Safety. Interrogators, revealing prior surveillance, question Gaal on Seldon's Project and Trantor's predicted destruction. Gaal confirms Seldon's psychohistorical forecast of Trantor's fall within three centuries, defending its math.

Seldon's lawyer, Lors Avakim, arrives, his device blocking spy beams. He explains Trantor's aristocratic families control the Commission, making appeals useless. Avakim then reveals Seldon *predicted* Gaal's arrest, orchestrating it to force the Commission's hand, accelerating plans. He assures Gaal the project's success probability is over 99.9%, while Gaal's personal outcome is 77.2%. Avakim then reveals Seldon is also arrested.

A guard confiscates Avakim's recorder, leaving Gaal alone. The trial quickly commences, focusing on an unperturbed Seldon before a small, hostile audience. Listeners should anticipate how Seldon defends his controversial predictions and what fate awaits him and Gaal.
