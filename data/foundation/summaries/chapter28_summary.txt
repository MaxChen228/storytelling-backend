The Grand Master declares trader Gorov's goods worthless and accursed, threatening him with death by gas for sacrilege. Limmar Ponyets, a fellow trader, intervenes, claiming to be a "Tender of the Soul" to gain access to the condemned man. He successfully manipulates the pious Grand Master, who allows him to visit Gorov in his cell, believing Ponyets will offer spiritual consolation.

Inside the heavily guarded cell, Gorov explains Askone's deep-seated rejection of nuclear technology, which they associate with a hated imperial past. The Foundation's mission is to subtly introduce nuclear gadgets to create a pro-tech faction, but Gorov, a diplomat, is ill-suited for the task. The Grand Master demands gold as ransom. Ponyets, a seasoned salesman, realizes he is uniquely positioned to achieve the Foundation's objective while also fulfilling his own sales quota. He decides to take over the mission, driven by profit and his reputation.

Ponyets returns to the Grand Master and his council, presenting a mysterious box with feigned confidence. He notes the hostile atmosphere and immediately identifies Pherl, the Grand Master's thin-faced favorite, as his primary target. Ponyets prepares to negotiate, knowing his success hinges on outmaneuvering the hostile council and their leader.
