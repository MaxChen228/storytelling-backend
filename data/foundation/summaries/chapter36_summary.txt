The Commdora openly despises her husband, the Commdor, accusing him of plotting with "barbarians." The Commdor silences her threats of mutilation by forcing a nuclear-powered necklace upon her. Hober Mallow, meanwhile, expresses unease to Jaim Twer about their too-easy access to Korell's steel foundry, suspecting a trap or limited nuclear tech, possibly for war industries. At the foundry, Mallow demonstrates advanced nuclear tools – a shear, plane, and drill – captivating the court. His excitement turns to shock: the Commdor's bodyguards carry nuclear hand-weapons bearing the Galactic Empire's "Spaceship-and-Sun" emblem. Mallow realizes the long-gone Empire is re-emerging in the Periphery.

Two days later, Mallow secretly leaves the *Far Star*, appointing Drawt acting captain. He gives Drawt sealed orders: wait two months, then, if Mallow doesn't return, proceed to Terminus with a Time Capsule report, revealing nothing. Mallow departs in a lifeboat on a solo mission. Elsewhere, old Onum Barr, having lost everything, faces an unknown intruder without fear. Listeners should anticipate the implications of Mallow's secret mission and the identity of Onum Barr's mysterious visitor.
