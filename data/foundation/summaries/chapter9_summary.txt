Sub-prefect Haut Rodric of Anacreon arrives on Terminus, openly dismissing the Foundation's scientific work as useless and its Chairman, Dr. Pirenne, with contempt. After a tense dinner, Rodric reveals Anacreon's true agenda: a new treaty with the Emperor grants them authority to establish a military base on Terminus and demand "taxes." Pirenne furiously asserts Terminus's status as a State-supported, tax-free Imperial institution, but Rodric dismisses the Emperor's distant power, emphasizing Anacreon's proximity and might.

Hardin pragmatically questions the payment form. He reveals Terminus lacks gold or metals, relying on imports, making tribute impossible. Unfazed, Rodric proposes payment in land, suggesting Anacreon's nobility could claim vast, unoccupied land. He hints at titles and estates for cooperation, effectively proposing a colonial takeover. The Foundation's science and Imperial protection prove powerless against Anacreon's aggressive expansion. Listeners should anticipate the Foundation's desperate struggle to maintain its independence against this blatant power grab.
