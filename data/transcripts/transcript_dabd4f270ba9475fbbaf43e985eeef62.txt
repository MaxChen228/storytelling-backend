<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we followed Vin as she moved silently through the misty city of Fadrex. She was searching for a weakness, a secret that could help her friends. Tonight, her search leads her to one special house, and to one very strange man.
</Person1><Person1>Vin has finished looking around the city. She lands in a quiet square, just as her friend Cett told her to. Picture this place. There are big houses, called mansions, with large gardens and beautiful trees all around them. It is very dark and quiet. Vin walks down the street, counting the houses. One… two… three… four. At the fourth mansion, she jumps easily over the tall gate. She is quiet, like a shadow.
</Person1><Person1>She moves toward the house. She doesn’t know what she will find. Cett hasn't been in this city for two years. But he said this person… this informant… could help her. Mmm. An informant is a person who gives information to someone else, usually secret information. Vin needs secrets.
</Person1><Person1>And just like Cett said, there is a light on at the back of the house, on a balcony. Vin waits in the darkness. The mist is cold around her, but it also hides her. She does not trust Cett. She worries this is a trap. Being careful, she uses her magic and flies up into the air. She lands softly on the balcony railing, next to a ladder.
</Person1><Person1>There is a man sitting there. An old man. He is reading a book by the light of a lamp. He has a warm, woolen blanket over his legs and is smoking a pipe. He doesn’t even look up. Vin wonders… did he see her? Did he hear her? She clears her throat, making a small sound. “Yes, yes,” the old man says, his voice very calm. “I shall be with you in a moment.”
</Person1><Person1>Vin just watches him. What a strange man. He has big, bushy eyebrows and white hair. He wears the nice clothes of a nobleman, with a big fur collar on his coat. He seems completely calm. He doesn't seem to care that a Mistborn, a powerful magic user, is sitting on his railing. Finally, he closes his book and turns to her. “Do you enjoy stories, young lady?” he asks.
</Person1><Person1>Vin is here for a mission, not stories. “What kind of stories?” she asks. “The best kind, of course,” the man says. “Stories about monsters and myths.” Vin shakes her head. “I don’t have much time for stories,” she says. The man looks out at the mist. “It makes me wonder,” he says, “what is so interesting about the real world.”
</Person1><Person1>Vin secretly uses her magic to check him. He is not an Allomancer. He has no magic. So… what is he doing? Why is he so calm? “I was told that you could give me information,” Vin says carefully. “That I can do,” the man says with a small smile. “I have a lot of information.” Then he adds, “But you might find most of it useless.”
</Person1><Person1>Vin thinks for a moment. “I’ll listen to a story,” she says, “if that’s what it will cost.” The man laughs softly. “No, no. You don’t make a story a cost. What is your name?” “Vin Venture,” she says. “Cett sent me.” “Ah, Cett,” the old man says. “That scoundrel. He was my writing friend, you know. A fine poet. But he didn’t like stories either. He liked things to be gritty and real.”
</Person1><Person1>The old man, whose name is Slowswift, tells her to sit in a chair. Vin is still wary, but she sits down. “Now,” Slowswift says. “What do you want from me?” “I need to know about Yomen, the king of this city,” Vin says. “He’s a good man,” Slowswift answers immediately. This is not what Vin expected to hear. An enemy is supposed to be evil, right? But she remembers Elend. Her friends once thought he was an enemy, and now she is married to him.
</Person1><Person1>“What has Yomen done that is so good?” Vin asks. Slowswift explains. After the Lord Ruler died, the world was in chaos. People were scared and starving. Yomen came and brought order. He brought back something very important. He brought stability. Stability is a situation where things are calm and do not change suddenly. It means safety. Yomen gave the people what they knew before. The nobles had their parties, and the skaa had their work. People knew their place again.
</Person1><Person1>“Parties?” Vin asks. “The world is ending, and Yomen is throwing balls?” “Of course,” Slowswift says. “He rules by keeping things familiar. It makes people feel safe. In fact, there is a ball tonight.” Even with an army outside the city, a ball is happening. Yomen uses these parties to show everyone that he is in control, that everything is okay.
</Person1><Person1>Vin listens. This is more complicated than she thought. Yomen is not just a simple enemy. He is a leader people trust. “So,” she says, finally. “What’s his weakness? Where should we strike?” Slowswift is quiet for a long moment. He puffs on his pipe, the smoke mixing with the mist. “Well?” Vin asks. The old man looks at her. “I just told you that I like the man, child,” he says. “What would possess me to give you information to use against him?”
</Person1><Person1>And there we must stop. Vin has found her informant, but he refuses to help her. He is loyal to Yomen. How can Vin possibly get the information she needs now? Next time, Vin must decide if she should tell Slowswift the truth. A truth about the end of the world, her own identity, and a hidden treasure that could change everything. Join us again for the next part of the story.</Person1>
