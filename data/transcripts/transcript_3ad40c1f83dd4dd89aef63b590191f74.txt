<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, TenSoon was in a very difficult situation. He was on trial, and he told the judges he killed another kandra. But then, right at the end, he said something shocking. He said, ‘I did not break my Contract.’ How is that possible? Let’s find out.
</Person1><Person2>That was such a cliffhanger! I can't wait to hear his explanation.
</Person2><Person1>Picture the room. It’s a serious, quiet chamber. TenSoon is standing before the judges. The leader, KanPaar, is confused. He asks TenSoon, ‘Are you saying your master wanted you to help his enemy?’
</Person1><Person2>A fair question, right? It seems like a direct contradiction.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. And TenSoon says no. He says, ‘I decided to serve a greater Contract. The First Contract!’
</Person1><Person2>The First Contract? The one with the Lord Ruler? But... he's gone.
</Person2><Person1>That's what one of the judges shouts! ‘The Father is dead!’ How can TenSoon serve a contract with someone who is dead? This is TenSoon’s big idea. He says, ‘Yes, he is dead. But the Contract is not! Vin killed the Lord Ruler. She is our Mother now. Our First Contract is with her!’
</Person1><Person2>Wow. That is a huge statement. Calling Vin, the person who destroyed their entire system, their new Mother. I can't imagine how they reacted.
</Person2><Person1>Can you imagine the silence in that room? The judges are completely shocked. The text says KanPaar was stupefied.
</Person1><Person2>Stupefied? What does that mean exactly?
</Person2><Person1>Mmm… that’s a great question. ‘Stupefied.’ To be stupefied means you are so surprised that you cannot think or speak. It’s like your brain just… stops for a second. KanPaar was stupefied because TenSoon’s idea was so new and so completely unexpected.
</Person1><Person2>That makes perfect sense. He was speechless.
</Person2><Person1>He was. And when KanPaar finally finds his voice, he's angry. He calls TenSoon’s words ‘fantasies’ and ‘blasphemies.’
</Person1><Person2>Blasphemy... that sounds serious. It's like saying something against a religion, isn't it?
</Person2><Person1>Yes, exactly. Blasphemy is when you say something very disrespectful about what a group of people believe is sacred or holy. For the kandra, the Lord Ruler was their Father. So, saying Vin is now their Mother is a huge, huge blasphemy to them.
</Person1><Person2>But TenSoon believes it. He's not just saying it to save himself, is he?
</Person2><Person1>No, he truly believes it. He doesn’t stop there. He warns them that the world is changing. The mists are different. He says, ‘Ruin has come!’ He’s trying to tell them they can’t just hide in their caves anymore.
</Person1><Person2>And KanPaar just thinks he's gone crazy from living with humans for too long.
</Person2><Person1>Right. But then, TenSoon does something even bolder. He interrupts KanPaar and shouts his real secret. He says, ‘I told her. I told her our Secret.’ He told Vin how Allomancers can control kandra.
</Person1><Person2>Oh, no. That's the one thing they're all terrified of. Their greatest weakness.
</Person2><Person1>And it gets worse. He says she actually did it. She took control of his body and made him fight! This is the worst crime a kandra can imagine.
</Person1><Person2>So he admits to betraying them in the most fundamental way possible. Why would he do that?
</Person2><Person1>Because he believes it was the right thing to do! He shouts that Vin, as the new Mother, had the right to know. She inherited everything from the Lord Ruler, including the kandra. He believes they should all go to her and serve her.
</Person1><Person2>So his entire defense is based on this idea that the whole power structure has changed, and they need to change with it.
</Person2><Person1>Precisely. After all this shouting, the room is silent again. TenSoon has said everything. He spent a year in a pit, planning this moment. But now… he wonders if anyone will even believe him. Will his words change anything?
</Person1><Person2>He looks for support, doesn't he? To the First Generation.
</Person2><Person1>He does. He looks up at the First Generation, the oldest and wisest kandra, hoping for some help, some mercy. But… nothing. They are completely silent. It’s like they aren’t even there.
</Person1><Person2>That must have been crushing. The ones who could have understood, and they do nothing.
</Person2><Person1>It allows KanPaar to smile. He says the First Generation has ignored TenSoon. So, the Second Generation will give the judgment. He tells TenSoon, ‘Your sentencing will occur in one month’s time.’
</Person1><Person2>A month? That's strange. Why wait?
</Person2><Person1>We don't know yet. But for TenSoon, it’s over. He has had his say. He told them the secret is out. And maybe, just maybe, that will be enough to make his people think.
</Person1><Person2>So, TenSoon’s fate is decided, but he has planted a seed of truth. What will grow from it? We will have to wait and see.
</Person2><Person1>Next time, we leave the dark caves of the kandra and return to Vin and Elend. Vin is very worried. She sees her friends are losing hope, especially Sazed after Tindwyl’s death. Elend, as the emperor, realizes it’s his job to lift their spirits and make things better. We’ll see how he plans to do that.
