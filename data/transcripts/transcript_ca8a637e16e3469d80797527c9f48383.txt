<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we were with Sazed at the Pits of Hathsin. He felt so lost, remember? He refused to be a leader for his people. And he was very worried about the strange “mist deaths.” Today, we are going to travel back in time. We will look at the early days of Kelsier’s plan, and we will learn a secret about one of his friends.
</Person1><Person1> Let’s start with a memory. A memory of Kelsier. He had a big secret. He called it the “Eleventh Metal.” He told everyone that this special metal could kill the Lord Ruler. He said he found it after a lot of research. But… nobody knew where he was for many years. He only said he was “in the West.” His story was a mystery. Even his oldest friends started to have questions. They were not sure if they could trust him completely. It was like a small seed of doubt, you know? A tiny seed that could grow into a big problem later.
</Person1><Person1> Mmm… now, let’s leave that memory. Let’s travel far away, to the Eastern Lands. We are going many years into the past. The Lord Ruler is still alive. Imagine a small, poor house. A skaa shack. Inside, a young boy falls to the ground. He is dirty and wears old clothes. He is too young to work in the mines. So, he plays in the dusty streets with other children.
</Person1><Person1> This boy… is Spook. But that is not his name yet. In the story, the older Spook is remembering this moment. He is very sick from his wounds, and his mind is full of dreams from his past. He is remembering what it felt like to be that small boy on the floor. A big man is standing over him. This man is a miner. His skin is dirty with dust. This man… is his father. The man spits on the floor. He is angry.
</Person1><Person1> There are many other people in the small, dark room. A woman is crying. Her tears make clean lines on her dusty face. Someone closes the door. Now, the red sunlight from outside is gone. The room is dark. The people are talking. They are deciding what to do with the boy. One man says, “We turn him in.” That means, they will give the boy to the Lord Ruler’s soldiers. Spook looks at the crying woman. She is his mother. But she looks away. She cannot meet his eyes.
</Person1><Person1> Spook tries to speak. He says, “Wasing the where of what?” His words are confused. This is because he speaks a special street language. The father gets angrier. He puts his boot on Spook’s neck and pushes him down. He says the boy is not coherent. That means he is not speaking clearly. Everyone is very, very afraid. They are afraid because Spook is different. He has powers. If the Lord Ruler’s servants find out, they might kill everyone in the village. They have seen it happen before. The servants, with spikes in their eyes, come and kill whole families. So, they cannot turn him in. But they also cannot let him go. What can they do?
</Person1><Person1> The father presses his boot down harder. He says there is only one thing to do. They must kill the boy. Nobody will miss a poor skaa child. Skaa died all the time in the Final Empire. It was a terrible, sad truth. Spook whispers, “Father.” But the man says, “You’re not my son!” He believes Spook is a monster from the mists. Spook cannot breathe. The room becomes black. But then… his special ears hear something. A sound. The sound of coins.
</Person1><Person1> Suddenly, the pressure is gone. Spook can breathe again. He sees beautiful copper coins on the floor. Skaa never used coins. Coins were for nobles. They were dangerous for skaa to have. But everyone in the room is staring at the money. A voice says, “The bag in exchange for the boy.” A man is sitting at a table. His face is gnarled. Gnarled means it is twisted and rough, like the bark of an old tree. He is eating. This man offers them the coins to save Spook’s life.
</Person1><Person1> The people are scared of this man, too. Spook’s father calls him a traitor. But Spook’s mother stops her husband. She knows this man is her brother. Spook’s uncle. She says, “He’ll kill you.” She tells her husband to take the money. It is better than killing the boy. And so, the father takes the coins. The mother turns away from Spook. Her body seems to say, “This is all I can do for you. This is how I can save you.” It’s heartbreaking, isn’t it? To be saved, he must be sold by his own family.
</Person1><Person1> The gnarled man stands up. He walks with a limp and uses a cane. This man is Clubs, who we know from Kelsier's crew. He tells the boy to come. Spook gets up slowly. He looks at his mother and father one last time, and then he runs outside, into the red sunlight. His uncle asks him, “You have a name, boy?” Spook thinks for a moment. His old name is gone now. He chooses a new one. He says, “Lestibournes.”
</Person1><Person1> Now, here is our language spotlight. Lestibournes. It’s a very interesting name. It comes from Eastern street slang. Street slang is a kind of informal language. It is used by people in a specific group or place. It can be like a secret code. The name ‘Lestibournes’ sounds like the words “Lefting I’m born.” This means, “I have been abandoned.” Or, “I was abandoned when I was born.” With this one word, this new name, he tells us all his pain. He feels his family has left him all alone. Later, Kelsier gives him the name “Spook,” because Lestibournes is too hard to say.
</Person1><Person1> So, this chapter gives us a powerful look into Spook’s sad past. We see the fear and cruelty of the Final Empire. But we also see a moment of rescue, even if it was a painful one. It shows us how strong Spook is to have survived all of that. Now, let’s think about what comes next. Remember that mystery about Kelsier’s Eleventh Metal? We are going to learn the truth. And it is a dark secret connected to a powerful being named Ruin. At the same time, we will go back to TenSoon, the kandra. He is trapped in a cage. But his enemies give him the one thing he needs to escape. It’s a story of secrets and a clever plan for freedom. I can't wait to share it with you next time.</Person1>
