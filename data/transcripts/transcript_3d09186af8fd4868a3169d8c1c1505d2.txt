<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left our young hero, Gaal Dornick, feeling very small on the giant planet of Trantor. He just arrived from his quiet home world, and now he is standing in a huge, noisy spaceport, ready to start his new life.
</Person1><Person1>Now, let's see what happens next. As Gaal walks away from the information desk, someone is watching him. A mysterious figure who was standing in the crowd now follows Gaal. Mmm... I wonder who that could be? This person is quiet. They listen as Gaal tries to find his way. This makes the story feel a little tense, doesn't it?
</Person1><Person1>Gaal feels lost. He finds himself standing in a line, in front of a railing. A small sign says "Supervisor." The man at the desk, the supervisor, doesn't even look up. He just asks, "Where to?" Gaal hesitates. He doesn't know the city, and he doesn't have much money. People are waiting behind him. The pressure is on. (pause) The supervisor asks again, a little impatient this time, "Where to?"
</Person1><Person1>Gaal tries to act cool. He says, "A good hotel, please." He tries to sound, uh, nonchalant. That's our first word today. Nonchalant (镇定自若的). It means you are trying to appear calm and relaxed, even if you are not. Gaal is worried about money, but he wants to seem confident.
</Person1><Person1>So, Gaal is trying to be nonchalant, but the supervisor is not impressed. "They're all good," he says. "Name one." Poor Gaal! He feels desperate now. "The nearest one, please," he says. The supervisor pushes a button. Suddenly, a thin line of light appears on the floor. It shines and moves, showing Gaal the way. The man puts a glowing ticket in Gaal's hand and says, "One point twelve."
</Person1><Person1>Gaal pays and asks, "Where do I go?" The man answers, "Follow the light." It's like magic! The ticket glows as long as Gaal walks in the right direction. Can you imagine that? A floor full of hundreds of people, all following their own glowing paths. It must look like a beautiful, strange dance. This tells us that Trantor is very advanced, but also very impersonal. You don't talk to people; you just follow the lights.
</Person1><Person1>Gaal's light trail stops. A man in a bright uniform takes his bags. "Direct line to the Luxor," the man says. The Luxor Hotel. And guess what? The mysterious person who was following Gaal hears this. Now he knows where Gaal is going. (pause) This is important. We should remember this detail.
</Person1><Person1>Gaal gets into a taxi. But this is not a normal taxi. It lifts straight up, inside the building! Gaal is amazed. He looks out the window and sees the huge room get smaller and smaller. The people look like tiny ants. Then, the taxi flies toward a wall full of holes and plunges into a dark tunnel. It's completely black, except for flashing signal lights. Gaal is flying through the inside of a building, inside a giant city. He has been on Trantor for a while now, but he has not seen the sky. Not even once.
</Person1><Person1>The taxi stops. "The Luxor Hotel," the driver says. Gaal gets out, gives a small tip, and the driver is gone. Gaal is alone again. He looks around. He is inside a hotel, inside a city, inside a world made of metal. He still hasn't seen the sun or the sky. He doesn't even know if it is day or night. It's a strange feeling, isn't it? To be on a planet but not feel like you are on a planet at all.
</Person1><Person1>Gaal feels a strong need to see the outside. He wants to see the real Trantor. First, he follows a sign to the "Sun Room." He is excited! But, oh, it's just a room with artificial lights. It's not the real sun. He is disappointed. So he goes to the front desk and asks about a tour or an observation tower. He just wants to be in the open air.
</Person1><Person1>The clerk checks the weather. He says, "Good weather." And then he says something very interesting. (soft laugh) He says, "I don't bother with the outside myself. The last time I was in the open was three years ago." Three years! Can you believe that? This tells us everything about life on Trantor. Most people live their whole lives under the metal shell of the city.
</Person1><Person1>Gaal gets a ticket for the observation tower. He gets into a special elevator. And this elevator is also very strange. As it goes up, the gravity changes! Gaal starts to float. He didn't read the sign that said to put your feet under a railing. The other passengers are smiling at him. He feels so clumsy and out of place. Then, a kind hand reaches out and pulls him down. He is very thankful.
</Person1><Person1>The elevator doors open. Gaal steps out onto an open terrace. The light is so bright it hurts his eyes. The kind man who helped him is right behind him. But Gaal doesn't look for a seat. He goes straight to the railing. He has to see the view. He leans over and looks at the panorama. That's our second word. Panorama (全景). It means a view of a very wide area of land. You can see everything from one spot.
</Person1><Person1>And what a panorama it is. But... it's not what you expect. He cannot see the ground. There are only buildings, buildings, and more buildings. The whole world, as far as he can see, is metal. A gray horizon of metal against the sky. There is no green. No trees, no soil, no grass. Only the work of man. He knows that somewhere, far away, is the Emperor's palace with a real garden. But from here, he only sees the power and might of the city. He is not thinking about the fleets of ships that must bring food every day. He is not thinking about any weakness. He only sees strength.
</Person1><Person1>At this moment, Gaal is just a young man, amazed by the greatest city in the galaxy. He feels like he is at the center of the universe. But we know something he doesn't. We know this mighty city has a secret weakness. And the man who helped him in the elevator? He is about to reveal some of Trantor's other secrets. Next time, Gaal will learn that Hari Seldon, the man he came to work for, is called "Raven" Seldon, because he predicts disaster. And soon after, Gaal will meet Seldon himself, and he will learn a terrifying truth about Trantor's future. A truth that puts them both in great danger. Join us then!</Person1>
