<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings.
In our last story, Elend and his army were waiting. They were waiting for the dangerous mists. General Demoux told Elend that their old leader, Kelsier, was not just a man. He was a god, the Survivor.
Now, let's join Elend. Picture him on his horse, watching his soldiers. He is a scholar, you know? A thinker. He understands exactly what is happening with the stories about Kelsier.
People are making Kelsier's life more… mystical. More magical. The story says Kelsier was being deified. That’s an interesting word. It means people were starting to see him as a god, not just a man. The church needed a heavenly power, not a normal person.
And, you know… a part of Elend is glad. It makes the story more believable. It makes it stronger. He remembers what Demoux said. How did a man from the streets survive so long? Before he got his powers? Mmm… maybe Kelsier really was special.
Then… someone screams.
Elend looks up. He scans the lines of soldiers. The mists are here. They are appearing in the air, like strange plants growing very fast. The men are starting to shuffle. They are nervous.
Elend cannot see the soldier who fell. But soon, it doesn't matter. Because other men begin to scream. The sun is going down. It is a blazing red color as it touches the horizon. Elend’s horse moves nervously beneath him. The captains shout orders. They tell the men to remain steady. To be still. But Elend can see the movement. He can feel the fear.
In the group of soldiers before him, empty spaces appear. The text says pockets appeared in the ranks. That’s a wonderful description, isn’t it? Imagine a line of soldiers, all standing together. Then, one man falls. Then another. These empty spaces are like pockets in the line. The men fall to the ground so suddenly. Like puppets, or marionettes, whose strings were just cut.
They shake on the ground. The other soldiers back away. They are filled with horror. And the mist is moving all around them.
Elend knows he must act. He thinks, "They need me." He is their leader. He grabs the reins of his horse. He uses his special Allomancy powers. He pulls on the emotions of the soldiers around him. He wants to give them courage.
He turns to his friend. “Demoux, let’s ride.”
He turns his horse to go. But… Demoux does not follow. Elend spins around. “Demoux? What—”
He stops. He cannot finish the word. Because he sees him. Demoux is sitting on his horse in the mists. And he is shaking horribly.
Even as Elend watches, his strong friend, the general, slips from his saddle. He collapses to the ground. He falls into the deep, dark ash below.
“Demoux!” Elend yells.
He jumps down from his horse. He feels like a fool. A complete fool. He never thought to wonder. He never asked if Demoux was in danger from the mists. He just… assumed. He assumed Demoux was already immune. Safe. Like Vin and the other heroes. But he was wrong.
Elend kneels beside his friend. His legs sink into the ash. All around him, he can hear soldiers screaming. He hears captains yelling, trying to create order from the chaos.
But Elend only sees his friend. Demoux twists on the ground. He is gasping in pain.
And the ash… the ash continues to fall.
So, in this terrible moment, Elend the leader is gone. He is just a man, kneeling in the ash. He feels helpless and foolish as his friend suffers. It shows us that even the strongest leaders can be caught by surprise. They can feel great fear.
This feeling of being lost… it is not just with Elend. In our next story, we will meet another friend, Sazed. He is also walking through the ash. But he is not in a battle. He is looking for something else. He is looking for hope. He is studying hundreds of old religions, searching for one true answer. But he only finds problems and doubt. Will he find the truth he is looking for? And what will happen to Demoux, shaking in the mists? We will find out next time.
