<Person1> "Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we felt the tension as a special visitor, Anselm haut Rodric, arrived on Terminus. Mayor Hardin was worried about this man from the powerful world of Anacreon. Now, Rodric is about to meet the leader of the Encyclopedia Foundation, the very proper Doctor Pirenne. Let’s listen to what happens."
</Person1><Person2> "I'm curious to see how this meeting goes. Pirenne seems so focused on his books, and Rodric is a man of action."
</Person2><Person1> "Exactly. And the meeting starts with a tour. Pirenne is so proud of the Encyclopedia Building. He shows Rodric everything… the huge libraries, the editing rooms, the publishing departments. He talks and talks, explaining how important their work is."
</Person1><Person2> "And what does Rodric think of all this?"
</Person2><Person1> "Mmm… not much. The story says he has a 'glazed eye' and a 'vacant smile.' Can you picture that? It means he looks completely bored. He is not interested in this great scientific project at all."
</Person1><Person2> "Oh, that must have made Pirenne feel awful."
</Person2><Person1> "It gets worse. After seeing everything, Rodric says his first real sentence about the project. He says, 'This is all very interesting… but it seems a strange occupation for grown men. What good is it?'"
</Person1><Person2> "Wow. He actually said that out loud? That's incredibly rude."
</Person2><Person1> "It is. And Pirenne… he has no answer. The story says his face was very eloquent, meaning his expression showed all of his anger and shock without a single word."
</Person1><Person2> "The dinner that evening must have been uncomfortable."
</Person2><Person1> "Very. Rodric spent the whole time talking about himself, telling stories about a war with a neighboring kingdom. He described broken spaceships with great excitement. Pirenne and Hardin just had to sit and listen."
</Person1><Person2> "So Rodric is a military man, through and through. Science and books mean nothing to him."
</Person2><Person1> "That's right. And after dinner, on a beautiful balcony under the stars, he finally says why he is really there. He says, 'And now… to serious matters.'"
</Person1><Person2> "Here it comes. The real reason for his visit."
</Person2><Person1> "Yes. He tells Pirenne that the Emperor's power is just a 'nice theory.' He says Terminus is in a dangerous position, right between Anacreon and their enemy, Smyrno. And he says Anacreon must protect Terminus."
</Person1><Person2> "Protection. That word usually comes with a price."
</Person2><Person1> "It does. Rodric says Anacreon will establish a military base on Terminus. And, of course, Terminus must pay for this protection. He calls it 'taxes.' But Hardin, the clever mayor, knows what this really is. He says, 'Terminus is to be a protectorate and to pay tribute.'"
</Person1><Person2> "Tribute. What does that word mean here?"
</Person2><Person1> "That's our first language spotlight. Tribute. It’s a special kind of payment. A smaller, weaker place pays it to a bigger, stronger place to be safe. It’s not really a choice. It shows who is really in control."
</Person1><Person2> "Got it. So Anacreon wants to control Terminus and take its money."
</Person2><Person1> "Exactly. But Hardin has a surprise for Rodric. He asks, 'How would you take these taxes? In gold?' Then he laughs. He explains that Terminus is a planet with almost no metals. They import everything. Their money isn't even made of gold or silver."
</Person1><Person2> "What is it made of?"
</Person2><Person1> "Hardin tosses a coin to Rodric. It’s made of steel. Steel! Rodric is shocked. Terminus has no gold, no chromium, nothing valuable to give."
</Person1><Person2> "So Hardin's point is that they can't pay, even if they wanted to?"
</Person2><Person1> "Yes. Pirenne is shouting about the Emperor and how they are a scientific foundation, but Rodric doesn't care. He says, 'Encyclopedias don't win wars.' He is only interested in power and money."
</Person1><Person2> "This brings us back to Rodric's question, 'What good is it?' The encyclopedia is useless in this situation."
</Person2><Person1> "It seems so. Since Terminus has no money, Rodric has a final, terrible idea. He says they can pay with land. He wants to give the empty, fertile land of Terminus to the rich nobles of Anacreon."
</Person1><Person2> "He wants to just… take their planet?"
</Person2><Person1> "Essentially, yes. And then he tries to bribe Pirenne. He says that if Pirenne cooperates, he can get a title and his own piece of land. He's trying to make a deal."
</Person1><Person2> "But earlier, Hardin said something that made Rodric pause. What was that about?"
</Person2><Person1> "Ah, good catch. That's our second language spotlight. When they first met, Hardin said Terminus was under the 'direct control of the Emperor.' The story says this seemed to disconcert the envoy. To disconcert means to make someone feel worried or confused. For a moment, Rodric was silent and thoughtful. Hardin's words made him wonder if the Emperor was still powerful."
</Person1><Person2> "But now Rodric seems confident the Emperor can't help."
</Person2><Person1> "He is. He tells Pirenne, 'Anacreon is a lot nearer.' The message is clear. The powerful neighbor is more important than the distant Emperor."
</Person1><Person2> "So, what's the takeaway from all this?"
</Person2><Person1> "The situation seems hopeless. Pirenne is clinging to old rules and the idea of the Empire, but those rules are broken. Anacreon has the real power, the military power. And Terminus has nothing to defend itself with—no army, no money, no valuable resources. They are trapped."
</Person1><Person2> "It sounds like they have no choice but to agree to Anacreon's demands."
</Person2><Person1> "It certainly feels that way, doesn't it? Pirenne is angry and lost. Rodric thinks he has won. But Mayor Hardin… he has been mostly quiet, watching, and thinking. Perhaps Terminus has one last secret, something Rodric knows nothing about. Next time, we will discover Hardin's secret plan, and it involves a very special, and very dangerous, kind of power. Goodbye for now."</Person1>
