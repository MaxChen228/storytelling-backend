<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we left Vin in a very dangerous fight. She was alone against a terrifying Steel Inquisitor. She was hurt, and she needed help. But then, just as things looked their worst, something happened.
</Person1><Person1>Suddenly, Vin sees something. Blue lines, moving quickly through the air. These lines show her where metal is. And then… a handful of coins fly through the ash. They surprise the Inquisitor from behind, cutting into its body. The creature screams in pain and surprise.
</Person1><Person1>And there, on top of the hill, is Elend. He has come to help her. His beautiful white uniform is now dirty, soiled with ash and blood. But his face is clean, and his eyes are bright. He is a Mistborn, you know, just like Vin. And now, the Inquisitor is wounded.
</Person1><Person1>They have a few moments before the koloss reach them. Vin dashes forward with her knife. Elend attacks too. For the first time, the Inquisitor’s smile fades. It has to watch both of them now. It tries to jump away, to escape.
</Person1><Person1>But Elend is ready. He flips a single copper coin into the air. The Inquisitor sees this and smiles again. It thinks it knows Elend’s plan. It expects a normal Push. It thinks they will both be thrown back. But… it is wrong. So very wrong.
</Person1><Person1>Elend is no ordinary Allomancer. He is so powerful! He gives a sudden, violent Push. Mmm… a <lang xml:lang="en-US">violent push is a very strong and fast push. It is not gentle at all. The surprised Inquisitor is thrown away, falling through the air. Even Vin is shocked by his strength.
</Person1><Person1>But the fight is not over. The Inquisitor is strong. It gets up and catches Vin’s arm. A shock of pain goes up her wounded arm and she cries out. He throws her to the side. The world spins. When she looks up, she sees Elend swinging his dueling cane.
</Person1><Person1>The Inquisitor blocks the hit, and the wood shatters. Then it hits Elend hard in the chest. The koloss are now only a few feet away. Vin pushes herself toward the Inquisitor again. She doesn’t have her knife anymore, but the Inquisitor has also lost its axes. She tackles him, but he is much bigger and stronger. He throws her down, and she can’t breathe.
</Person1><Person1>Just then, Elend grabs one of the fallen axes and strikes. But the Inquisitor moves with a sudden jolt of speed. Its form becomes a blur. A <lang xml:lang="en-US">blur… that is when something moves so quickly that you can't see it clearly. Like a fast car driving past. Elend swings only at empty air.
</Person1><Person1>The Inquisitor appears behind Elend. It holds a long, sleek metal spike. It moves inhumanly fast. Vin knows this is not normal power. The creature raises the spike, ready to hit Elend in the back. Vin is too far away to help. What can she do? Can you imagine her fear in that moment?
</Person1><Person1>But the koloss… the koloss are not too far away. They are right there. Desperate, Vin has an idea. She flares her brass and grabs the emotions of the koloss closest to the Inquisitor. She takes control of its mind.
</Person1><Person1>Even as the Inquisitor moves to attack Elend, Vin’s koloss spins. It swings its giant, wedge-like sword. And it hits the Inquisitor directly in the face. It doesn’t cut the head off. It just… crushes it completely. The Inquisitor drops without a sound. Motionless.
</Person1><Person1>A shock runs through the entire koloss army. “Elend!” Vin shouts. “Now!” Elend turns. He understands. Vin can feel his power. He sends out a great wave of emotion, Soothing thousands of koloss all at once. They all stop fighting. They lower their weapons. In the distance, the last of Elend's human army stands, exhausted.
</Person1><Person1>Ash continues to fall from the red sky. But the battle is over. Elend has won.
</Person1><Person1>What an incredible fight. Vin and Elend used their minds, not just their strength, to win. But while one battle ends, another story is beginning somewhere else. Next time, we will leave the battlefield. We will go to a sad place called the Pits of Hathsin, where we will meet our old friend Sazed. He is facing his own kind of battle… a battle inside his heart. He is learning about strange new deaths in the mists, and he feels he is not the leader his people need. Join us next time to find out what Sazed discovers. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
