<Person1>
Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2).
Last time, Vin met an old informant named Slowswift. He was a storyteller who liked the city’s leader, Yomen. And he did not want to help Vin. But Vin is not a person who gives up. She believes she can change his mind.
So, the conversation continues. Vin looks at the old man. She says, "That’s what you do—sell information.”
But Slowswift shakes his head gently. “I’m a storyteller,” he says. He believes stories are special. They are not for everyone. He asks Vin, "Why should I talk to those who would attack my city?"
Vin tries to convince him. She offers him a powerful job when they win. Slowswift just laughs softly. Mmm... he is not interested in power. Then, she offers him money. A lot of money.
The old man looks at her. His voice is firm but not angry. “I sell information, child. Not my soul.” Wow. He has very strong beliefs, doesn't he? He believes some things are more important than money or power.
Vin feels frustrated. "You’re not being very helpful," she says.
Slowswift smiles a little. He asks her a very important question. "And tell me, dear child… Why exactly should I care?"
He stops talking. He just puffs on his pipe. He looks like the conversation is over. Vin thinks for a moment. She understands. He is a nobleman. He likes the old world. He doesn't like change.
But Vin knows that change is coming. She stands up. Her voice is strong now. “I’ll tell you why you should care, old man.”
Can you picture it? Vin, standing in the mist, speaking to the old man on his balcony. She tells him to look around. The ash is falling. The mists are dangerous. The world is shaking.
"Change is looming," she says. Looming... that's our first word today. Looming means a big, and often bad, event is going to happen soon. Like a dark cloud before a storm is looming. Vin is saying that a huge, scary change is coming for everyone.
She tells him that even his leader, Yomen, cannot stop it. She says, "I hate it too. But things can’t stay the same." And then she says something really powerful. "...when nothing changes in your life, it’s as good as being dead.”
She turns to leave. But the old man’s voice stops her.
"They say you’ll stop the ash," he says quietly. "Turn the sun yellow again... They call you Hero of Ages.”
Vin pauses. She looks at him through the mist. "Yes," she says. It's a big job, a big destiny. But she has to try.
Slowswift is silent for a moment. Then he says, "Sit down, child."
He has changed his mind. Vin’s words... they worked. He tells her that Yomen is a good man. But, he is only a mediocre leader. Mediocre... that's our second word. Mediocre means something is just okay. It's not good, but it's not bad either. A mediocre meal is a meal you forget quickly. Slowswift is saying Yomen is not the great leader they need now. Not when the world is ending.
He tells Vin two of Yomen's weaknesses. First, Yomen still believes in the Lord Ruler. Even though the Lord Ruler is dead! It's a belief that is misplaced, or wrong. And a misplaced belief can be a very big weakness.
Second, Yomen has a lot of money. A secret, huge amount of money. No one knows where it came from.
Vin knows. She immediately thinks of the atium! The special metal they are looking for. Her reaction is too quick. Slowswift sees it. He smiles and tells her she needs to hide her feelings better. (soft laugh) He is a very smart old man.
He says that is all the information he has. But as Vin gets ready to leave, he clears his throat. He says that usually, people give him compensation. You know, payment. Vin smiles. She throws him a bag of gold coins.
Then, she jumps into the night.
But Vin is always careful. She uses her powers to check if Slowswift is following her. He is not. He was just an old storyteller. She trusts his words, but she wants to be sure. So she goes to find a second informant. A beggar named Hoid.
She finds the place. It's a dark square, with ash everywhere. She sees a group of beggars. And she sees one man sitting alone, humming. Just like her instructions said.
But... something feels wrong. Mmm... Vin gets a bad feeling. She doesn't know why. It’s just a feeling in her gut. She doesn't stop to think. She trusts her instinct. She turns and jumps away into the mist.
Have you ever had a feeling like that? A feeling that tells you to stop, or to leave? Vin has learned to listen to that feeling. It has saved her many times.
She flies through the city. She follows a road Cett told her about. Soon, she sees a very large building. It's the Canton of Resource. A very important place for the government here. And a place Yomen, the mediocre leader, controls.
So, Vin now has the information she needs. She knows Yomen's weaknesses. And she has a good idea where the atium might be. She also trusted her instincts and avoided a possible trap. Her next step is clear. She must get closer to that building. She needs to scout Yomen's palace.
But as she plans her next move, she will soon discover she is not alone in the mists. Someone is watching her. Someone is following her. And this person is a Mistborn, just like her. But there is something... different about this one. Something she has never felt before.
Who is this mysterious follower? And what do they want? We'll find out next time.
Thank you for listening. Goodbye for now.</Person1>
