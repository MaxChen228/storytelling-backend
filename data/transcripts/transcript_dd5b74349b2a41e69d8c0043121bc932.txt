Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings.
Last time, we learned how the author decided to write a new Foundation story. He was ready to explore new ideas after many years. Now, the adventure finally begins. We are going to meet a young man on a journey that will change his life.
(pause)
Let's meet our main character. His name is Gaal Dornick. And, as the story says, he was just a country boy. Imagine a young man from a small, quiet town. He has never seen a really big city before. But this is not just any city. He is traveling to Trantor. Trantor is the center of the entire Galactic Empire. It's the most important planet of all.
Gaal is very smart. He has a new doctorate in mathematics. And he has a very special invitation. The great Hari Seldon, a famous mathematician, has asked him to come to Trantor. Gaal will join the vast and mysterious Seldon Project. For a young scholar like Gaal, this is the most exciting moment of his life.
He is on a giant, glistening spaceship. A cool, beautiful machine from 12,000 years of Imperial progress. He has been in space before, but only for a short trip near his home. This is different. This is a journey across the stars.
He feels a little nervous about the Jump through hyper-space. It's the only way to travel so far, so fast. The story says you can cross the whole galaxy in a moment. He waits, with a little dread curled gently in his stomach. But then... it's just a tiny jar. A little internal kick. It's over before he is even sure he felt it. (soft laugh) Sometimes the things we worry about are not so big, are they?
After that, Gaal spends his time in the View-room. He loves watching the stars. He sees a star cluster, like a swarm of fire-flies, stilled forever. He sees a cold, blue-white nebula, spreading across the window like distant milk. It’s all so beautiful. He is waiting for one thing: his first sight of Trantor.
But then, an officer comes in. The View-room will be closed. Gaal is so disappointed. He asks the officer, "Would it be possible to let me stay? I would like to see Trantor." He worries that he speaks with a provincial accent. That he sounds like he's from a small place.
The officer is kind, but he says no. It's too dangerous. The ship is landing on the side facing the sun. It's too bright, too hot. The officer tells him Trantor would only be a gray blur anyway. Gaal feels a lump in his throat. He knows it's childish to feel so sad, but he can't help it. He wanted to see it so much.
(pause)
This brings us to our language spotlight. The story says Gaal was a "country boy." A country boy (鄉下男孩 xiāngxià nánhái) is someone who grew up in a rural area, not a big city. It suggests someone who is simple, maybe a little innocent, and not used to complex city life. This is a perfect description for Gaal right now.
And what about that feeling he had? A "lump in his throat." A lump in your throat (喉嚨哽咽 hóulóng gěngyè) is that tight feeling you get when you are very sad or disappointed, almost like you are going to cry. It’s a very physical way to describe a strong emotion.
So, our country boy feels a lump in his throat. He is alone, far from home, and his first big wish on this trip did not come true.
(pause)
Finally, the ship lands. There are many noises. The hiss of the atmosphere, the drone of the conditioners, and the rumble of the engines. Gaal feels the ship stop. The gravity changes from the ship's gravity to the planet's gravity. The air on Trantor seems a little thicker. The gravity feels a bit greater.
He walks out into the Debarkation Building. And... it is tremendous. Immense. The roof is so high, it's almost lost in the heights. He can't even see the opposite wall. There are just people and desks, fading into a haze in the distance. He is in a place built on a scale he has never imagined. He feels so small. An annoyed man at a desk checks his visa and then jerks a thumb, telling him where to find the taxis.
So, Gaal has arrived. He is standing on Trantor, the center of the universe. He is overwhelmed, a little disappointed, but also at the beginning of the greatest adventure of his life.
His journey on this incredible city-planet is just starting. He needs to find his way, and he doesn't know that someone is already watching him. Next time, Gaal will try to see the sky of Trantor. We will discover what a planet completely covered by a city looks like. And we will learn that this magnificent, powerful world has a secret, critical vulnerability. What could possibly threaten a city that covers an entire planet?
