<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left TenSoon in a very difficult situation. He was on trial, in front of all the other kandra. He was accused of breaking his contract, his most important promise. But just as the judge was about to speak, TenSoon said something nobody expected. He looked at them all and said, “I did not break my Contract.” How can this be true? Let’s find out.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine the quiet, serious room. KanPaar, the judge, is confused. He asks TenSoon, “Are you saying your master, Zane, wanted you to help his enemy?” It’s a logical question. But TenSoon says, “No.” He then explains his shocking reason. He says, “I did not break my Contract because I decided to serve a greater Contract. The First Contract!”
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… the room goes completely silent. The First Contract was their original promise to the Lord Ruler, their Father. But another kandra shouts, “The Father is dead!” How can TenSoon serve a contract with someone who is gone? TenSoon agrees the Father is dead. But he says the Contract is not dead. He tells them that Vin, the woman who killed the Lord Ruler, has taken his place. He then says the most shocking thing of all. He says, “She is our Mother now. Our First Contract is with her!”
</Person1><Person1>This idea is… well, it’s a blasphemy. Blasphemy is when you say something that is very disrespectful to what people believe is sacred or holy. For the kandra, the Lord Ruler was their Father. To call the person who killed him their new Mother… that is the biggest blasphemy they can imagine. KanPaar is stunned. He calls TenSoon’s words “fantasies” and “nonsense.”
</Person1><Person1>But TenSoon doesn’t stop. He asks KanPaar if he has been outside their caves recently. He says the world is changing. The mists are different. He feels that something terrible is coming. He shouts, “Ruin has come! Life will end!” He believes they cannot just hide in their caves anymore. They must change.
</Person1><Person1>Then, TenSoon decides to tell them everything. He knows he has a real sin, a real crime. He interrupts KanPaar, his voice getting louder and louder. He yells, “I told her! I told her our Secret!” He’s talking about Vin. He told Vin the kandra’s biggest, most dangerous secret. He told her how Allomancers can control them. He explained their greatest weakness.
</Person1><Person1>This is where we see what TenSoon means by a greater Contract. This is a promise or a duty that is more important than any other promise. For TenSoon, his duty to Vin—the new Mother—was more important than his duty to keep the kandra’s secret. He believed she had the right to know. He says, “She is the Mother! She inherited everything the Lord Ruler had.” He thinks the kandra should go to her and serve her, especially if the world is ending.
</Person1><Person1>Finally, KanPaar has heard enough. He bellows, “Enough!” The chamber falls silent again. TenSoon stands there, breathing hard. For a whole year, while he was trapped in a deep pit, he planned this moment. He planned to tell his people the truth. But now… he wonders if they will even believe him. Will his words change anything?
</Person1><Person1>He looks up at the oldest kandra, the First Generation. They sit silently in the shadows. He hopes they will understand. He hopes they will see that he is right, that they must help Vin. But… nothing happens. No sound. No movement. They just watch. KanPaar smiles a cold smile. He tells TenSoon that the First Generation has ignored him. So, the Second Generation will give the judgment. He says, “Your sentencing will occur in one month’s time.”
</Person1><Person1>A month. TenSoon had his chance to speak. He told them the secret was out. But it seems it was for nothing. He has been judged, and he will be punished. His great sacrifice seems to have failed. While TenSoon’s story ends here for now, in this dark and silent place, we turn our attention back to Vin and Elend. They won the great battle, but the war for their future is just beginning.
</Person1><Person1>Vin is very worried. She sees that her friends, the brave people who fought beside her, are losing their hope. Their victory feels fragile, and a deep fear is growing in their hearts. Elend, now the emperor in his white uniform, must face this new enemy. It’s not an army with swords, but the feeling of hopelessness itself. He knows it is his duty to make things better, to lead his people. But how do you fight a feeling? We will see what he decides to do next time. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
