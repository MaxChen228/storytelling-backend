<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we were with Elend as the dangerous mists returned. His soldiers, and even his friend Demoux, suddenly collapsed in the strange fog. Elend was left standing in the middle of growing chaos, feeling completely helpless. Today, we leave that scary scene. We are going to join another friend, Sazed. And Sazed… well, he is also feeling very, very lost.
</Person1><Person2>Picture this. Sazed is standing on a road. But it's not a normal road. Everything… the ground, the air… is covered in black ash. The world is gray and quiet. He is with his friend, Breeze, and about two hundred soldiers. And they are doing something very sad. They are saying goodbye to their last horse.
</Person2><Person1>Mmm, yes. The horse was once a beautiful white color. But now, its coat is a rough, dirty gray from all the ash. You can see its ribs under its skin. The poor animal is very thin. The story says it is malnourished. That’s a word we can look at. Malnourished means not having enough good food to eat to be healthy and strong. There just isn’t enough food for the horse anymore.
</Person1><Person2>Exactly. So Sazed gently slaps the horse, sending it away to live on its own. He hopes it can find some small plants to eat under all the ash. Watching the lonely horse run away feels… important. It feels like a symbol for how difficult their world has become. It’s a sad sight.
</Person2><Person1>It really is. After the horse is gone, Breeze asks Sazed if he wants to ride in the carriage with him and Allrianne. The soldiers have made the carriage lighter, so they can pull it themselves. But Sazed says no. He says, “I shall walk for a bit.” Why do you think he wants to walk in that difficult, ashy ground?
</Person1><Person2>I think… he has a lot on his mind. As he walks, the story tells us he is full of troubled feelings. He feels a heavy weight, a deep sadness. He recently visited his friends, Vin and Elend. But the visit didn't make him feel better. It actually made him feel worse.
</Person2><Person1>Worse? But why? They are his dear friends.
</Person1><Person2>He is thinking about Vin, and something she did. He thinks to himself, "Vin allowed Elend to die… and she did it because of things I taught her." Imagine carrying that thought. He feels responsible for his friend's death. It’s a terrible, heavy feeling.
</Person2><Person1>Oh, that’s awful. So he feels guilty. And that’s not all, is it? He feels like people always come to him with their problems, asking for answers. But he feels he has no answers for himself. He feels like a… a hypocrite. Let’s talk about that word. A hypocrite is someone who says, ‘You should do this,’ but then they do the opposite thing themselves. Sazed feels he can give good advice, but he can’t follow his own advice to feel better.
</Person1><Person2>That’s it exactly. He feels completely lost. So, what does he do? He turns to the one thing he has always trusted: his knowledge. He carries a large portfolio, which is like a very big, flat bag for papers. Inside, he has information on hundreds and hundreds of old religions.
</Person2><Person1>Right. He thinks that religion is supposed to help people through difficult times like these. So he opens his portfolio as he walks. He hopes to find an answer, some truth, some comfort in one of them.
</Person1><Person2>But he doesn't. He looks through the pages, but he finds only problems. He knows these religions too well. He sees their flaws, their mistakes, their contradictions. He thinks a perfect god, a true divinity, would not let the world be destroyed. A perfect god would not let good people suffer and die while trying to help.
</Person2><Person1>So even his religions are failing him. What a desperate feeling. He is physically walking through a world of ash, and mentally, he is walking through a dark place of doubt and sadness. He feels a dark suffocation, like he can’t breathe.
</Person1><Person2>Mmm. But he doesn't give up. He takes out the next sheet of paper, the next religion in his collection, and he begins to study it as he marches with the soldiers. He has to keep looking. He has to find an answer. He is too scared to even think about what he will do… if there aren't any answers at all.
</Person2><Person1>So Sazed’s journey continues, both across the land and inside his own heart. And his search is going to take him somewhere very, very important. Soon, he will leave the soldiers and travel alone. He is going to a place called the Pits of Hathsin.
</Person1><Person2>The Pits of Hathsin! That’s where the hero, Kelsier, was a prisoner for so long. It’s a place of great suffering.
</Person2><Person1>It was. But when Sazed gets there, he won't find a dark prison. He is going to find something… or someone… completely unexpected. He will find his own people, the Terris people, living there! They have built a new home in that old, sad place.
</Person1><Person2>Wow! That’s amazing. His own people.
</Person2><Person1>And that’s not the biggest surprise. When the Terris elders see him, they greet him with great respect. They bow and they call him by a new title. They call him… “Your Majesty.”
</Person1><Person2>Your Majesty? Like a king? Why would they call him that? What does it all mean?
</Person2><Person1>Mmm… that is a wonderful question. And it’s a story for our next meeting. Thank you for listening to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Until our next story, goodbye.</Person1>
