<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. When we last left Hober Mallow, he was standing trial, his career and life hanging by a thread. He had just stunned the entire council chamber by revealing he knew his accuser was a spy from the very beginning. But that was just the opening move. Now, in front of a hostile crowd and his political enemies, Mallow is about to present the evidence that will change everything.
</Person1><Person1>Mallow begins by describing his own feelings when he first heard about the missionary on his ship. He admits he was utterly confused, saying he was, quote, "at sea - and completely." Mmm… that’s a wonderful English idiom. To be ‘at sea’ means to be completely lost or bewildered, with no idea what to do next. And that’s exactly where Jorane Sutt wanted him. But even in that confusion, Mallow did one crucial thing. He sent the spy, Twer, away for five minutes. And in that short time, he set up a Visual Record receiver to capture everything that was about to happen.
</Person1><Person1>Now, standing before the council, he announces he has that very recording with him. Can you just imagine the energy in that room? The mayor is banging his gavel for order, the gallery is roaring, and across the planet, millions of people are leaning closer to their screens. Jorane Sutt, the mastermind behind this whole trial, can only watch, his eyes blazing, as Mallow prepares to turn the tables.
</Person1><Person1>The lights dim. Ankor Jael, Mallow’s ally, makes the adjustments, and a hologram flickers to life in the center of the chamber. It’s so real—in color, in three dimensions—it lacks only life itself. We see the scene exactly as the prosecution described it: the battered missionary, the questioning, the angry mob appearing out of nowhere. We hear their growl. We see Mallow draw his gun as the priest is dragged away, lifting his arms for a final curse. And then… there’s a tiny flash of light from the missionary’s hand. It’s there and gone in an instant. The scene ends. The lights come up.
</Person1><Person1>Mallow’s voice cuts through the silence. He points out that, yes, on the surface, the incident is exactly as the prosecution says. But he then begins to poke holes in the story. He asks the questions no one else thought to ask. Where did this missionary suddenly come from in the middle of a desolate, nearly empty landscape? And more importantly, where did a gigantic, angry mob come from when the nearest town was a hundred miles away? It just doesn’t add up, does it?
</Person1><Person1>He also points out how… conspicuous the priest was. Think about it. A man supposedly risking his life, hiding from the authorities, is parading around in a brand-new, very distinctive priestly costume. It’s almost like he wanted to be noticed. Mallow says it all felt phony, like a trap set by the Korellians to force his hand. But the prosecution has ignored all of this. They’ve also, strangely, provided no background on the priest himself—Jord Parma. No birthplace, no history, nothing. Mallow explains that this is because they can’t. The reason the scene felt phony… is because it was phony. He declares, "There never was a Jord Parma."
</Person1><Person1>The chamber erupts into chaos again. Once there’s a semblance of quiet, Mallow asks for the lights to be dimmed one more time. He’s going to show them an enlargement of a single, frozen frame from the recording. The ghostly, waxen figures appear again, frozen in time. The missionary, Jord Parma, is caught mid-shriek, his arms stretched upward. And on his hand is that little gleam of light, but this time, it doesn’t disappear. It’s a permanent glow.
</Person1><Person1>"Keep your eye on that light," Mallow’s voice calls out from the shadows. The image bloats, enlarges, until only the hand fills the entire space. The light resolves into three fuzzy, glowing letters: K… S… P. Mmm. What could that mean? Mallow’s voice booms out the answer. It’s a special tattoo, invisible in normal light but revealed by the ultraviolet light he used to make the recording. K S P, he announces, stands for "Korellian Secret Police."
</Person1><Person1>The missionary was an impostor. A secret agent. The entire event was a meticulously planned trap, and Mallow’s enemies, Sutt and Manlio, wanted him to fall right into it. They wanted him to sacrifice his ship, his crew, and his mission to save a man who was never in real danger, a man who was playing a part. He was, as Mallow puts it, an agent "tricked out in the robes and verbal gymnastics" of a priest. I just love that phrase. ‘Tricked out’ means to be dressed in a very flashy, elaborate way. And ‘verbal gymnastics’ refers to using clever, complicated language to deceive someone. It perfectly describes an actor performing a role.
</Person1><Person1>Well, the revelation completely shatters the prosecution's case. The mood of the crowd turns on a dime. The angry roars become cheers of triumph. Mallow is lifted onto the shoulders of his supporters, carried through a mob that is now chanting his name: "Long live Mallow! Long live Mallow!" He has not only won his freedom; he has become a hero.
</Person1><Person1>But for Mallow, the trial was just the beginning. A couple of days later, he tells a weary Ankor Jael his next move. He’s not going to rest on this victory. He tells Jael to have Sutt and Manlio arrested for endangering the state. He plans to use the mob's enthusiasm, this powerful but fickle force, to clear his path to power. Because a Seldon Crisis is coming, and Mallow is convinced that to survive it, he must be in charge. He must be both Mayor and High Priest.
</Person1><Person1>So, Mallow has masterfully turned his enemies' plot against them and seized incredible political momentum. But what is this crisis he’s so concerned about? In our next chapter, we’ll discover Mallow’s shocking strategy to deal with Korell: he plans to do nothing at all. He believes the true threat isn't Korell, but a far greater power pulling the strings from the shadows—the Galactic Empire itself. Join me next time as the stakes get even higher. </Person1>
