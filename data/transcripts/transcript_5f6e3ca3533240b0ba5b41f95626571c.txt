Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host. I'm so glad you're here.
Last time we were together, Master Trader Hober Mallow found himself in a very dangerous position. He had stood up to the powerful Jorane Sutt, defending his right to trade freely. But Sutt cornered him, not with arguments about trade, but with a threat… a trial for murder, for abandoning a Foundation priest on a hostile planet. Mallow, unyielding, accepted the challenge. And we were left wondering… how could he possibly win a fight like this?
Today, we see the trap spring shut. But the question is… for whom?
The chapter opens with Mallow's friend, Ankor Jael, laying out the terrifying truth of Sutt's plan. It’s a chilling conversation. Jael explains that Sutt is using religion as a weapon. "Suppose one man," he says, "one ambitious man, uses the force of religion against us, rather than for us." He means Sutt, of course. Sutt’s goal isn't just to stop Mallow; it’s to seize power for himself. By painting Mallow as an enemy of the faith, a heretic, he could rally the religious masses and… well, eventually make himself king.
It’s a brilliant, and deeply cynical, strategy. Jael reminds Mallow of what the great Salvor Hardin once said: 'A nuclear blaster is a good weapon, but it can point both ways.' Religion, in Sutt's hands, is that weapon. And it's pointed directly at Mallow.
Mallow, ever the man of action, just slaps his thigh and says, "All right, Jael, then get me in that council, and I'll fight him."
But Jael knows it isn't that simple. He brings up the priest Mallow is accused of letting die. "Is it true?" he asks. And Mallow, almost carelessly, says, "It's true enough." He even reveals that he knew the eyewitness, Jaim Twer, was Sutt's spy from the very beginning!
Mallow believes he's safe because his actions were perfectly legal. The priest was on the planet illegally, used as bait by the local government. Mallow thinks a trial will just make Sutt look like a fool.
But Jael… Mmm, Jael sees the deeper game. He shakes his head. "No, Mallow, you've missed it." He explains that Sutt doesn't need to convict him. He just needs to ruin him. He needs the people to see Mallow not as a clever trader who followed the law, but as a… a "cowardly dog, an unfeeling brute, a hard-hearted monster." If the public turns against him, his political career is over. He could even lose his citizenship.
Jael finishes with a heavy heart. "My boy," he says, "I'll stand by you, but I can't help. You're on the spot, -dead center."
That’s our first language spotlight today. "On the spot." When you’re put ‘on the spot,’ it means you’re in a very difficult situation, often one where you’re being targeted and have to make a tough decision immediately. Mallow is right in the center of Sutt’s trap.
And then, the scene shifts. Can you just picture it? The council chamber on the day of the trial. It is absolutely packed. The galleries are overflowing with people, and outside, huge crowds are gathered around public screens, the 'visors, watching every moment. The air is thick with hostility. This isn't a trial; it's a spectacle.
Jael barely manages to push through the chaos to reach Mallow. He hands him something, something Mallow had asked for. Mallow seems completely calm, almost excited. While Jael worries about lynch mobs and the High Priest, Publis Manlio, stirring up religious fanatics, Mallow just smiles. "Sit here," he whispers, "and watch the fun."
(soft laugh) Fun! In the middle of his own trial. You have to admire his nerve.
And then, it’s his turn. A single spotlight hits him as he walks to the center of the chamber. He stands there, a lonely, defiant figure, broadcast to billions of people across the Foundation.
And what he says next is… a masterstroke.
He begins easily, quietly. "To save time," he says, "I will admit the truth of every point made against me… The story of the priest and the mob… is perfectly accurate in every detail."
The room just erupts. A triumphant snarl comes from the gallery. They think he’s confessed! He’s trapped! But Mallow just waits patiently for the noise to die down.
Then he continues. He says the picture they painted wasn't complete. And he asks for the chance to supply that completion. He starts his story not with the priest, but with his very first meetings with Jorane Sutt and… Jaim Twer. He says he was suspicious from the start. Why would these two powerful men suddenly take an interest in him? He was looking for, in his words, the "ulterior motive."
And that’s our second language phrase. An "ulterior motive" is a secret reason for doing something. It’s the real goal hidden behind the one you’re showing to the world. Mallow knew Sutt and Twer weren't being honest about their intentions.
And then he delivers the first, stunning blow to the prosecution's case. He talks about Jaim Twer. Twer claimed to be a trader with a normal, non-religious education. But Mallow noticed something impossible. Twer had never heard of a Seldon Crisis.
Mallow lets the significance of that sink in. He asks the council: who, with a normal education in the Foundation, could possibly be ignorant of a Seldon Crisis? It's the very foundation of their history! There is only one group educated to ignore it… the priesthood.
"I knew at that instant," Mallow declares, his voice ringing through the silent chamber, "that Jaim Twer had never been a trader. I knew then that he was in holy orders and perhaps a full-fledged priest."
A spy. A paid man of Jorane Sutt.
Suddenly, the whole story changes. Twer isn't a reluctant friend testifying out of conscience. He's an enemy agent. And Mallow reveals that this is why he invited Twer on his voyage. He knew Sutt would place a spy with him, so he chose to keep a known enemy close, where he could watch him. It’s absolutely brilliant.
The chapter ends right there, on that cliffhanger. Mallow has completely discredited the prosecution's star witness. He’s shown everyone that this trial is built on lies and secret plots. And he finishes by saying that this knowledge explains a certain action of his when the priest first appeared… an action that, until now, has been unknown.
So, the takeaway here is about control. Sutt thought he controlled the story, using public emotion and religion to trap Mallow. But Mallow has shown that he is a better strategist and a better storyteller. He's not just defending himself; he's exposing a conspiracy at the highest levels of government.
And now, we have to wait to find out what this secret action was. Next time, Mallow will play his final card. He has evidence, a visual recording, that will prove the entire incident with the priest was an elaborate setup. The man who begged for Mallow's help was not who he seemed, and the forces arrayed against Mallow are about to be exposed in a way that will shake the Foundation to its core. The hunter is about to become the hunted.
It’s a powerful lesson in looking for the ulterior motive, for the story behind the story. Always question what you’re being told, and why.
Until next time, happy reading.</Person1>
