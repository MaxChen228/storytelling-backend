<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left Elend giving his people new hope. He told them to smile, to be like the Survivor, Kelsier. He gave everyone a job, preparing them to march. But today, we are leaving Elend's camp. We are going somewhere much darker, inside the mind of a man trapped by a terrible power.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine this. A man sits alone in a camp full of monsters. He is sitting on a tree stump, and he has not moved in hours. He is like a statue. Ash falls from the sky, covering his shoulders and hair in a layer of grey dust. This is Marsh. And he is thinking.
</Person1><Person1>He feels like he is missing something. An important piece of information. A dark force, a power called Ruin, controls him. But lately, Ruin has been busy with other things. It has left Marsh alone with his thoughts. And that is a dangerous thing.
</Person1><Person1>He doesn't struggle. To struggle, to fight back, would bring Ruin's attention. And a strange part of him... doesn't want to fight. When Ruin controls his mind, the dying world seems wonderful. It is a feeling of bliss, which means perfect happiness. But it is a false happiness. And he knows it.
</Person1><Person1>No! he thinks. No, that’s not what I want! He struggles against himself now. He struggles against the feeling that it's useless to fight.
</Person1><Person1>His power, and his prison, comes from something called Hemalurgy. This is a very important word in our story. Hemalurgy is a kind of magic connected to blood. To transfer power this way, someone always has to die. It is a... a messy and disturbing process. Marsh has many metal spikes in his body from this magic. These spikes give him great power, but they also allow Ruin to control him.
</Person1><Person1>He looks around at the army of monsters, the koloss. There are three hundred thousand of them. They haven't moved in weeks. The army is starting to stagnate. That is when something stops moving or making progress. The koloss are just sitting here, fighting and killing each other. It seems like a waste. Why is Ruin waiting? Why not attack?
</Person1><Person1>Marsh is supposed to be the most powerful of all the Inquisitors. He has the most spikes. So why did Ruin leave him here, just sitting in the ash? Mmm... he thinks it doesn't matter. The end has come. The world will end. There is no way to win.
</Person1><Person1>He feels shame for that thought. He remembers a time, long ago, when he was the leader of the skaa rebellion. Thousands of people looked to him. But then... he gave up. He left the rebellion right before his brother, Kelsier, returned and did the impossible. Kelsier defeated the Lord Ruler.
</Person1><Person1>That should have been me, Marsh thinks. He feels a deep tragedy. He gave up then, and he is giving up now. He feels so much frustration. He thinks, Damn you, Kelsier! Can’t you leave me be even in death?
</Person1><Person1>He remembers Mare, the woman both he and Kelsier loved. She chose Kelsier. And when she died, Kelsier fought for her dream. She dreamed of a world with flowers and a blue sky. Kelsier didn't succeed. He made things worse, in a way. But... he died trying. He died for her dream. Marsh just gave up.
</Person1><Person1>But then, a new thought comes to him. A plan. Ruin can see almost anything in the world. But it cannot see inside a person's mind. Marsh has not struggled for weeks. Maybe... maybe Ruin thinks he has finally given up completely. Perhaps, if he waits long enough, he can surprise it.
</Person1><Person1>He knows exactly what he will do. When the time is right. When it will cause the most damage to Ruin's plans. He will do one, final thing. He will reach back, pull the main spike from his body, and kill himself.
</Person1><Person1>This is not a plan of despair. It is a plan of hope. He knows he is an important tool for Ruin. By removing himself, he can give the others a chance. A real chance. Kelsier gave his life to free the skaa. Marsh will give his life to help save the world.
</Person1><Person1>And so, sitting there like a statue in the falling ash, Marsh finds his purpose. His own way to fight back. And that is the end of the first part of our story.
</Person1><Person1>But as Marsh sits and waits, the world is changing. Next time, we will see that the Mists are no longer Vin's friends. They are burning people, and they are afraid. Elend must make a terrible choice that will put his soldiers in great danger. What has happened to the Mists? Join me next time to find out. Goodbye for now.</Person1>
