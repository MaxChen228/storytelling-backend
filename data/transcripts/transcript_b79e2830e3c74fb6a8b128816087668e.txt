Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Elend and his friends in a very serious meeting. They decided to march to a new city, Fadrex, but first, they must solve a problem in a town called Urteau. Elend asked his friends to remember their old leader, Kelsier, and his brave spirit. Now, let’s see what happens next.
The room is quiet. The mood is heavy. Elend looks at his friends, his leaders. He knows they are sad and worried. He shakes his head slowly and says, “That is an indisputably depressing event.” Mmm… that’s a strong way to say something is very, very sad. But then, he says, “We can survive this.”
He believes they can win, but there is one important thing they must do. He tells them, “the only way that will happen is if our people don’t give up.” He says people need leaders who can laugh, leaders who show that this fight can be won. Can you picture it? The world is ending, ashes fall from the sky, but your leaders are smiling. Would that give you hope?
Elend then asks something very difficult. He says, “I don’t care if you’re an optimist or a pessimist… On the outside, I want to see you smiling.” He tells them to do it in defiance.
Now, let’s talk about that word… defiance. Defiance is when you refuse to obey someone or something. It’s like saying "no" with your actions. For example, if it's very cold, but you wear a t-shirt, that is an act of defiance against the weather. Here, Elend wants them to smile in defiance of the end of the world. Their smiles are a message. A message that says, "We are not afraid. We will not give up."
Elend finishes his speech by saying, “If the end does come, I want this group to meet that end smiling. As the Survivor taught us.” He is talking about Kelsier, of course. Kelsier always smiled, especially when things were bad.
Slowly, the people in the room start to nod. They understand. Even Sazed, who seems so troubled, agrees. But one man, Cett, just shakes his head. He says, “You people are all insane.” (soft laugh) Breeze, who always loves a joke, laughs and says, “Now, that’s a lie, Cett. You know exactly how you ended up joining with us. We threatened to kill you if you didn’t!” It’s a dark joke, but it breaks the tension a little bit.
Elend looks at Vin. She meets his eyes and nods. She thinks it was a good speech. She knows their group can’t be the same as it was in the beginning, laughing and happy. Too much has happened. But, she thinks, maybe… maybe if they remember Kelsier’s smile, they will remember why they are fighting so hard.
With that, the meeting is over. It is time for action. Elend says, “All right, people. Let’s start preparations.” He gives everyone a job. Breeze and Sazed must plan their trip to Urteau. Ham must send a message to get scholars working on new plants—plants that can grow with very little sun. And Demoux must tell the army the big news: “We march tomorrow.” Everything is happening so fast.
So, Elend has given his team a new kind of weapon: a smile. A smile as an act of defiance against despair. They have a plan, and they are ready to march. But the world is large, and their enemies are powerful.
And while they prepare to fight for the future… someone else is watching, and waiting. In our next story, we will meet a man named Marsh. He is an Inquisitor, one of the most feared beings in the empire. He is trapped, serving a dark power named Ruin. Marsh feels hopeless, but then he discovers a secret… a weakness in his enemy. And he makes a desperate plan. A plan to sacrifice himself, just like his brother Kelsier did, to give everyone else a chance to survive. What is his plan? And can he succeed? Join us next time to find out. Goodbye for now. </Person1>
