<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we left TenSoon in a dark pit. He had just escaped death by acid by demanding a trial, a judgment. We wondered why he would do this, knowing he was already seen as a traitor. Today, we find out.
</Person1><Person1>Let’s begin with something very important to the kandra people. It’s called the First Contract. Mmm… imagine a very old, very important set of rules. This was a list of promises the first kandra made to their powerful leader, the Lord Ruler. They wrote these promises down, and they became the first kandra laws. This First Contract was so important, the Lord Ruler had it put into steel and he signed it himself. It was the first thing a new kandra learned. It had rules about respecting older generations, rules for creating new kandra… and a rule for total loyalty to the Lord Ruler. But it also had a very dark rule. A rule that said, if needed, all kandra must… end their own lives. It's a heavy, powerful document, and it controls everything.
</Person1><Person1>Now, let’s go to the trial. Picture a large, quiet room. The lamplight shines on a figure with bones made of sparkling red crystal. This is KanPaar, the judge. He leans forward and his voice is sharp. “All right, then, TenSoon, traitor to the kandra people. You have demanded this judgment. Make your plea.”
</Person1><Person1>TenSoon takes a deep breath. Ah, it feels so good to have lungs again, to have a body. He is ready to speak. But KanPaar continues, his voice like a sneer. “Tell them,” he says, “explain, if you can, why you killed one of our own. A fellow kandra.”
</Person1><Person1>TenSoon freezes. This was not the question he expected. The room, called the Trustwarren, is completely silent. All the other kandra are watching. They have bodies made of rock, or wood, or metal. They just sit and wait. TenSoon stands there, feeling cold and naked on the platform. He finally speaks. “Yes, I killed a kandra,” he says. “That is not forbidden.”
</Person1><Person1>KanPaar points a finger at him. “Need it be forbidden?” he accuses. “Humans kill each other. But they are different. We are of Preservation. We are special. We don’t kill one another!” TenSoon is confused. Why is KanPaar asking this? The murder is a small crime compared to his other betrayal. The betrayal of their greatest secret. Why start here?
</Person1><Person1>“I was compelled by my Contract,” TenSoon says simply. This phrase, ‘compelled by my Contract,’ is very important. It means he was forced to do it because of the rules he must follow. It was not his choice. He continues, “You must know, KanPaar. You gave me the Contract for the man Straff Venture.” TenSoon explains that Straff Venture gave him to his son, Zane. And it was Zane who ordered him to kill the other kandra, OreSeur. He had to do this to take OreSeur’s place and spy on a woman named Vin.
</Person1><Person1>At the name Vin, there are quiet whispers in the room. (soft laugh) Oh yes. They have all heard of her. She is the one who killed their Father, the Lord Ruler. KanPaar’s voice gets louder. “And so you did what this Zane commanded? You killed another kandra. You murdered a member of your own generation!”
</Person1><Person1>TenSoon’s frustration grows. “You think I enjoyed it?” he demands. “OreSeur was my generation brother! I knew him for seven hundred years! But… the Contract…” KanPaar interrupts. “The Contract forbids killing,” he says. “It forbids the killing of men.” He asks if a kandra’s life is not worth more than a man’s. “The words are specific, KanPaar,” TenSoon snaps back. “I know them well—I helped write them! They forbid us from killing humans, but not each other.”
</Person1><Person1>KanPaar leans forward again. “Did you argue? Did you try to get out of it?” “I do not argue with my masters,” TenSoon says. He explains that Zane was unstable, dangerous. He could not risk telling a man like that how to kill a kandra. So, he just did it. He killed OreSeur and took his place. “That is what we do!” he says with frustration. “We are spies! That is the point of the Contract!”
</Person1><Person1>Another kandra speaks up, saying they do these things to humans, not to each other. He says TenSoon has set a disturbing precedent. That means he has started something new and dangerous. And then, TenSoon understands. Mmm… it’s a plan. It’s so clever. KanPaar is trying to make him look like a rash, disloyal traitor first. If everyone believes he is a thoughtless murderer, then they won’t believe him later, when he talks about the bigger secret.
</Person1><Person1>He smiles. He is of the Third Generation. He is old and wise. It is time to act like it. “I betrayed us with my rashness?” he asks. “What of you, glorious Seconds? Who allowed a Contract to be given to Kelsier himself? You gave a kandra servant to the very man who was planning to kill the Father!”
</Person1><Person1>KanPaar looks like he has been slapped. His face is angry in the blue light. He tells TenSoon it is not his place to make accusations. “I have no place anymore, it seems,” TenSoon replies sadly. He says none of them do, now that the Father is dead. And they helped it happen. KanPaar quickly stops the conversation. He says this is not a trial. TenSoon already admitted his guilt. This is a judgment, a time for sentencing. TenSoon becomes silent. It is not time to push. Not yet.
</Person1><Person1>“Now,” KanPaar says, his voice cold. “Let us move on. Why don’t you tell the First Generation why… you broke Contract with your master? Why did you disobey him and help his enemy instead?” The question hangs in the silent room. This is the real reason he is here. TenSoon closes his eyes. He remembers watching Zane and Vin fight. Zane was his master. He held TenSoon’s Contract. But TenSoon helped Vin. And in helping her, he revealed the greatest Secret of the kandra… their weakness. The secret they serve to protect. The secret that keeps them from being slaves.
</Person1><Person1>TenSoon opens his eyes. He looks at all the silent faces watching him. This is the moment he has been planning for. He stands tall and announces, “I didn’t break my Contract.”
</Person1><Person1>How can that be true? He admitted he helped Vin, his master’s enemy. He knows his actions led to his master’s death. He says he didn’t lie, but he also says he didn’t break his contract. It seems impossible. TenSoon believes he was serving a different contract, a higher one. A First Contract with Vin herself, who he calls… their Mother. What could this possibly mean? And what is the great danger he calls the Resolution? We will have to find out what this new, impossible truth is. That's all for today. Join us next time for another chapter of Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2).</Person1>
