<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! We are starting a new, incredible story today. And it begins in a very, very dark place, inside the mind of a man who is fighting for his own soul.
</Person1><Person2>I'm ready. It sounds intense.
</Person2><Person1>It is. Let's begin. Picture a man named Marsh. He is trying to do something terrible… he is trying to kill himself. Can you imagine that? His hand is shaking. He wants to reach to his back and pull out a metal spike. Pulling it out would end his life, a life he feels is monstrous, just awful.
</Person1><Person2>Why does he feel his life is monstrous? What has he become?
</Person2><Person1>For three years, he has been something called an Inquisitor. And for three years, he has been a prisoner. Not in a jail with bars, but a prisoner inside his own thoughts. He has tried to break free, but he knows there is no escape.
</Person1><Person2>A prisoner in his own mind... That's a terrifying thought. It's like he's not in control of himself.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. And just as he thinks this, something else takes control. He calls it… “It.” Suddenly, the world feels different. He can see clearly. All his worry is gone. He thinks, “Why was I worried? Everything is fine.”
</Person1><Person2>So this “It”... it changes how he feels? It makes him okay with his situation?
</Person2><Person1>Yes, completely. Now, Marsh’s body is… different. He has large steel spikes driven through his eyes. So he doesn’t see like we do. Instead, the spikes let him see the world in glowing blue lines. These lines show him the shape of the room and the people inside it.
</Person1><Person2>Wow. So he sees energy, or metal, instead of light? That's... a strange kind of power.
</Person2><Person1>It is. And he’s not alone. There are other Inquisitors with him, all with the same spikes through their eyes. They all stand there, seeing in blue lines. But there is one person in the room who is different.
</Person1><Person2>Who is that?
</Person2><Person1>A man is tied to a table in front of Marsh. This man is their prisoner. He is a good man, a Terrisman steward, but now he is trembling with fear. He whispers, “Please…”
</Person1><Person2>Oh, no. So Marsh is being forced to hurt this person?
</Person2><Person1>Yes. The part of him controlled by “It” is enjoying this. It picks up a new spike from a table. But then… for just a moment… the real Marsh grabs control again. The joy disappears. He feels horror. He smells blood and death. He knows this prisoner is a good man, a Keeper who helps people. To kill him would be a tragedy.
</Person1><Person2>So he's fighting back! Can he stop it?
</Person2><Person1>He tries. He tries to force his own arm to move, to pull the special spike from his back and end it all. But “It” is too strong. This power, this force, has a name. It calls itself Ruin.
</Person1><Person2>Ruin... That name sounds very... destructive.
</Person2><Person1>It is. Ruin was freed from a prison, the Well of Ascension, by a woman named Vin. And now, Ruin needs the Inquisitors to be its hands in the world. It needs them to find something hidden, something it needs to become complete.
</Person1><Person2>So Marsh is just a puppet for this… Ruin.
</Person2><Person1>Mmm… that’s a perfect way to describe it. A puppet. And as Ruin takes full control again, Marsh smiles. The prisoner begins to cry. Marsh steps forward and raises the spike. He is about to perform something called Hemalurgy. It’s a messy, terrible art.
</Person1><Person2>What does that mean, Hemalurgy?
</Person2><Person1>It means he must drive the spike through the prisoner’s heart… and into the body of another Inquisitor tied underneath him. The part of Marsh that is Ruin thinks this is fun. He picks up a mallet… and begins to pound.
</Person1><Person2>That's... horrifying. We leave him in that moment?
</Person2><Person1>We do. We see the terrible power of Ruin and the good man trapped inside the monster. It leaves us wondering, is there any hope? Who could possibly fight something so powerful?
</Person1><Person2>I have no idea. It seems impossible.
</Person2><Person1>Well, our next chapter will take us to a very different place. We will meet a being named TenSoon. He is ancient and wise, but he is trapped in a dark pit, his body just a formless mass. He is waiting for his execution.
</Person1><Person2>From one prisoner to another. This story is very dark.
</Person2><Person1>It is, but there's a twist. Just as his captors try to kill him with acid, TenSoon does something completely unexpected. He shouts one word: “Judgment!” This single word stops his death and forces a public trial. Why would someone facing certain death ask for a trial that could reveal all his secrets and bring him even more pain? We’ll find out next time.
</Person1><Person2>I'm hooked. I need to know why.
