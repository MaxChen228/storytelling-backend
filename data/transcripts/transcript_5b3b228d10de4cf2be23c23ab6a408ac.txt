<Person1>Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host. Last time, we witnessed Salvor Hardin’s incredible victory. He returned to Terminus a hero after outsmarting Anacreon, securing the Foundation’s power not with weapons, but with strategy. And then… Hari Seldon appeared again in the Time Vault. He confirmed the second crisis was over, but he left us with a chilling warning, didn't he? He spoke of "Spiritual Power" and cautioned against overconfidence, reminding everyone that they were still surrounded by powerful enemies… and that a mysterious Second Foundation was waiting, somewhere out at Star's End.
</Person1><Person1>Today, we leave the high politics of Terminus behind and journey to the frontier, to the very edge of the galaxy. We’re meeting a new kind of hero. The Traders. The book describes them as reaching out with "tenuous fingerholds" across vast distances. Imagine that… like someone carefully, cautiously finding a grip on a massive wall in the dark. These aren't polished officials or scientists. They are described as lonely, daring figures whose ships were like "patchquilts of home-made repairs." They even had a motto, borrowed from Salvor Hardin himself: "Never let your sense of morals prevent you from doing what is right!" It makes you wonder, what kind of situations were they getting into?
</Person1><Person1>And that brings us to our main character for this chapter, Limmar Ponyets. We meet him in a… well, a rather undignified moment. The text says he was "completely a-lather." Can you picture that? It means he was covered in soap foam, or 'lather', from his shower when a call came through. Mmm… It's such a human, funny image. Even in the far reaches of space, you can’t escape interruptions in the shower. His ship is tiny, so snug that the shower is just a few feet from the control panel. He steps out, dripping and grumbling, to answer the call.
</Person1><Person1>It’s another trader, a young man named Les Gorm, who has chased him down with a message. And not just any message. It’s a Personal Capsule, a tiny, gleaming sphere that can only be opened by Ponyets. You know, this immediately tells us the news is urgent and secret. As Ponyets opens it, the thin tape inside unrolls, and almost as soon as he reads it, it turns black and crumbles into dust. Total secrecy. And his reaction? "Oh, Galaxy..." It's clearly not good news.
</Person1><Person1>The message is simple and dire. A fellow trader has been imprisoned on a planet called Askone. Now, Askone is what they call a "closed area." It's a place that absolutely refuses to buy any nuclear technology. For a trader like Ponyets, whose job is to sell the Foundation’s advanced gadgets, going there is, as he puts it, "murder." It means he can't make his sales quota, which is a huge deal for him. But he can't refuse. He tells Gorm, "Can't walk out on a friend." And then we learn a fascinating secret about Ponyets. He mentions he had a religious training, but was expelled! This adds such an interesting layer to his character, doesn't it? He’s not just a simple salesman.
</Person1><Person1>But the real secret, the one he doesn't tell Gorm, is the most dangerous part. The imprisoned man, Eskel Gorov, isn't just a trader. He’s an agent of the Foundation. Suddenly, the stakes are so much higher. This isn't just about rescuing a friend; it's a mission of state importance.
</Person1><Person1>So, Ponyets sets off for Askone, and the journey is a nightmare of bureaucracy. First, he’s met by warships. Then, for a whole week, he has to navigate what the book calls "clouds of minor officials." What a perfect description. You can just feel his frustration, having to sweet-talk every single person just to get one step closer to the man in charge. Finally, after two weeks, he gets an audience with the Grand Master of Askone.
</Person1><Person1>The Grand Master is a small man, but he has an immense, intimidating presence. He's weighed down by a huge fur collar, and he immediately tells Ponyets not to bother with threats or flattery. He knows exactly why Ponyets is there. He scoffs at the idea that the trader landed on Askone by mistake. He says, "Are you traders... so mad... that you can land on Askone's largest world... and consider it an unwitting boundary mixup?" He sees it for what it is: a coordinated rescue attempt.
</Person1><Person1>Ponyets tries to handle it diplomatically. He says the trader's actions, if deliberate, were "most injudicious." That's a wonderful word—'injudicious'. It means showing very poor judgment, or being unwise. He’s trying to sound formal and respectful, agreeing that the trader made a mistake while still trying to negotiate. But the Grand Master is not impressed. He cuts right through the fancy words and delivers the ultimate threat: Gorov is likely to pay with his life.
</Person1><Person1>You can feel the tension in the room. Ponyets’ stomach is in a knot. He pleads that death is so… final. "Irrevocable," is the word he uses. And that’s when the Grand Master reveals his true motivation. After a long pause, he says, "I have heard that the Foundation is rich." Ah. So that’s what this is all about. It’s not about justice or sacrilege. It's about ransom.
</Person1><Person1>And this is where we leave Ponyets, caught in an impossible situation. The Grand Master wants riches, but the only riches Ponyets carries are the very nuclear items that Askone has forbidden and considers accursed. How can he possibly pay a ransom? In our next chapter, we’ll see how Ponyets, the expelled religious student and master salesman, tries to talk his way out of this. The Grand Master will demand gold, a commodity Ponyets doesn't have. So, Ponyets will have to get creative, using his unique skills to manipulate the pious leader and gain access to Gorov. He’s going to have to sell something… but it won’t be what anyone expects. Join me next time to see if he can pull it off.</Person1>
