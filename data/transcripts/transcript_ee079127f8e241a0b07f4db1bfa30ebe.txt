Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time we were together, we saw the calculating Jorane Sutt send the master trader Hober Mallow on an incredibly dangerous mission. Remember, three Foundation ships have disappeared in the Korellian Republic, and Sutt suspects not only that Korell now has forbidden nuclear power, but that a traitor among the Traders may have given it to them. Mallow, an outsider himself, has agreed to travel to Korell as a spy disguised as a merchant. The stakes could not be higher.
Now, let's return to that dimly lit room, right after Mallow has left. Sutt is there with the Foreign Secretary, Publis Manlio. Can you just feel the tension? Manlio is deeply troubled by this plan. He thinks it’s a crude, obvious trap, and that a man as smart as Mallow won't be easily fooled. But Sutt, ever the strategist, simply refills his glass. He calmly explains that the risk is necessary. "If there is treachery," he says, "it is the capable men that are implicated." His logic is cold, but sharp. If there's a conspiracy, it involves the best and brightest. And if there isn't, well, you still need your best and brightest to uncover the truth.
Sutt patiently waits as Manlio gets lost in thought. The book describes him as being in an "uneasy reverie." Mmm, that’s a wonderful phrase, isn't it? A reverie is when you're lost in your own world, daydreaming. But adding the word "uneasy" tells us his thoughts are not pleasant. They’re full of anxiety and doubt. Finally, Manlio just bursts out with it: "Sutt, what's on your mind?"
And this is where Sutt reveals the true scale of what's happening. His voice is low, his words are heavy. "We're in the middle of a Seldon crisis."
Manlio is stunned. A Seldon crisis? Those are legendary moments in their history, times when the Foundation faced total destruction. He asks if Hari Seldon has appeared in the Time Vault, which is the usual signal. But Sutt shakes his head. He doesn't need a ghost from the past to tell him what he can see with his own eyes. He explains his reasoning, and it's quite brilliant. For the first time since the Galactic Empire fell, they have an opponent with nuclear power. That alone is significant. But it's happening at the exact same time they are facing a huge political crisis at home—the growing, uncontrolled power of the Traders. The two events happening together, he says, puts it beyond all doubt.
Manlio, however, isn't convinced. He argues that past crises involved a danger of complete extermination. He doesn't see that level of threat yet. But Sutt’s response is so insightful. He says, "Any fool can tell a crisis when it arrives. The real service to the state is to detect it in embryo." There’s our second key phrase. To detect something "in embryo" means to spot it at its very, very beginning, when it's just a tiny seed of a problem, before it grows into a monster. Sutt believes he is seeing the monster while it's still small. He reminds Manlio of their history, of Hari Seldon's great plan. The crises are scheduled, in a way, to push them along their thousand-year path to a new Empire. And according to the timeline... it's time.
Now Sutt reveals the next part of his plan. Before they can face the nuclear threat from Korell, they must solve their internal problem. They need to put their own house in order. And that means dealing with the Traders. He says they are too strong, too independent. They were educated by the Foundation, given all this knowledge, but they weren't raised with the Foundation's state religion, which was used to control people. They aren't bound by patriotism or faith. They are, in his eyes, a dangerously unpredictable element.
And who does he want to lead this political charge against the Traders? Manlio. Manlio is shocked. He protests, saying he has no talent for politics! But Sutt brushes his concerns aside. He tells Manlio to leave the strategy to him and dangles a very tempting prize: the possibility of combining the two most powerful positions in the government, Mayor and Primate, for the first time since the legendary Salvor Hardin. Sutt is not just dealing with a crisis; he's playing a masterful game of political chess.
Meanwhile, across town, we find Hober Mallow in a much more modest setting. He’s meeting with a man named Jaim Twer, a politician who wants to get more representation for the Traders on the government council. Twer wants Mallow to be the face of their movement. He flatters him, reminding him of how he controlled a room full of rowdy traders at a convention. He said Mallow put those "red-necked oxen" in his pocket. It's a very vivid, if not very polite, idiom. It suggests the other traders were simple, stubborn, and easily managed by someone as clever as Mallow.
But Mallow turns him down flat. He says he's leaving on business next week, super-secret business. When Twer hears that Mallow met with Sutt, he gets incredibly agitated, shouting that it's a trick to get Mallow out of the way. But Mallow is calm. He reveals to Twer the same secret Sutt revealed to Manlio: a Seldon crisis is coming.
And here we get a really funny, and telling, moment. Twer, this politician who wants to lead the Traders, just stares blankly. "What's a Seldon crisis?" he asks. Mallow is furious! How could an educated man, a leader, not know the absolute basics of their history? It shows us the deep divide between the political insiders on the Foundation home world and the practical, worldly Traders who live out in the galaxy. After explaining the whole thing, Mallow makes a surprising offer. He tells Twer to forget politics for a while and come with him on his mission. Just like that. Twer is hesitant, but Mallow's confidence—and the allure of adventure—is too strong. Twer agrees. Mallow is gathering his own team, on his own terms. He's not just a pawn in Sutt's game; he's a player. He ends by quoting Salvor Hardin: "To succeed, planning alone is insufficient. One must improvise as well." And Mallow is a master of improvisation.
So, the chapter ends with two parallel plots set in motion. Sutt is beginning his political campaign to bring the Traders under control, using Manlio as his public face. And Hober Mallow is heading out into the unknown, toward the hostile Republic of Korell, with his own hand-picked crew, ready to improvise his way through a crisis that no one fully understands.
And what awaits him in Korell is even more dangerous than he could imagine. We learn that Korell is a republic in name only, ruled by an absolute despot. When Mallow’s ship, the Far Star, arrives, they are forced to wait in a decaying spaceport for a week, completely ignored. But Mallow isn't discouraged; he sees a world ripe for new trade. The tension is thick as they wait in a standoff. Then, chaos erupts. A Foundation missionary, injured and delirious, is brought aboard against Mallow's strict orders, begging for protection from the locals. And at that exact moment, an alarm blares. A huge, angry Korellian mob has surrounded the ship.
We will leave it there for next time. What an incredible setup! Mallow is trapped, with a religious incident on his hands and an army at his door. What will he do? I can't wait to find out with you. Until then, happy reading.</Person1>
