<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Gentle Story Companion! Last time, we left young Gaal Dornick standing high above the city of Trantor. He was looking out from an observation tower, completely amazed by the view of a planet covered entirely in metal, with no sky or nature in sight.
</Person1><Person2> It sounds both incredible and a little scary. He must have been so overwhelmed.
</Person2><Person1> Exactly. He came away from the edge feeling a little <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="blæŋk aɪd">blank-eyed, you know, a bit dazed. The friendly man from the elevator was still there, and he pointed to an empty seat next to him. Gaal sat down.
</Person1><Person2> Ah, the helpful stranger. I wonder what he wants.
</Person2><Person1> Well, the man smiles warmly and introduces himself. "My name is Jerril," he says. "First time on Trantor?" And of course, it is. Jerril seems to understand Gaal's amazement. He says Trantor really affects people with a <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="poʊˈɛtɪk ˈtɛmpərəmənt">"poetic temperament"—people who feel things very deeply.
</Person1><Person2> But then he says something strange, doesn't he? About the people who actually live on Trantor?
</Person2><Person1> He does. He says Trantorians never come up to these towers. They don't like it. It gives them <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="nɜrvz">nerves. Gaal is shocked. He thinks the view is glorious! But Jerril explains that it's a <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="səbˈdʒɛktɪv">subjective matter of opinion.
</Person1><Person2> What does he mean by subjective?
</Person2><Person1> Mmm, that's a good question. It means something is based on personal feelings, not on facts. For Gaal, who grew up with open skies, this view is amazing. But for someone born in Trantor's underground corridors and rooms, seeing nothing but open space above you is terrifying. Jerril says it can cause a nervous breakdown.
</Person1><Person2> Wow. It's like they're afraid of the very thing Gaal traveled so far to see. A whole planet of people who prefer to live inside.
</Person2><Person1> It's true. Jerril even reveals that they are only five hundred feet up. Most of Trantor is built deep underground, like an iceberg. Miles and miles of city hidden from view. But then... Jerril's friendly tone changes a little. His good nature seems to evaporate, and he looks almost <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="slaɪ">sly.
</Person1><Person2> Oh, here it comes. The real reason for the conversation.
</Person2><Person1> Yes. He starts asking Gaal questions. "What do you think of it all?" "Are you here on vacation?" And finally, he asks about Gaal's job. Gaal explains he's here to work on Dr. Seldon's project.
</Person1><Person2> And Jerril knows that name.
</Person2><Person1> He does. But he calls him <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈreɪvən sɛldən">Raven Seldon. He says it's slang, a nickname, because Seldon keeps predicting disaster. Gaal is stunned. He had no idea. He only knows Seldon's mathematical theories. The conversation ends awkwardly, and Gaal, feeling annoyed, goes back to his room.
</Person1><Person1> But the surprises aren't over for the day. (pause) When Gaal enters his room, a man is waiting for him.
</Person1><Person2> Oh no. Is it Jerril?
</Person2><Person1> It's an old man, with very bright blue eyes. Before Gaal can even ask what he's doing there, the man introduces himself. "I am Hari Seldon."
</Person1><Person2> The man himself! What an entrance.
</Person2><Person1> Seldon explains that they must work quickly. He confirms Gaal's suspicion: Jerril was an agent from the Commission of Public Safety. He was following Gaal from the moment he arrived. Everything about Seldon's project is being investigated.
</Person1><Person2> So Gaal walked right into the middle of something very dangerous.
</Person2><Person1> He really did. Seldon then asks Gaal the same question as Jerril: "What does Trantor mean to you?" And again, all Gaal can say is, "Glorious." Seldon tells him he needs to learn to apply <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˌsaɪkoʊˈhɪstəri">psychohistory to all problems.
</Person1><Person2> And then he shows him what psychohistory can really do, right?
</Person2><Person1> Precisely. He takes out a small calculator pad. He says, "Let me show you the science of predicting the future of humanity." He inputs equations that represent the Empire today. Then, he starts adding more information: the probability of assassinations, economic problems, revolts...
</Person1><Person2> It sounds incredibly complex.
</Person2><Person1> It is. The symbols on the screen shift and change with each new piece of data. Gaal, a brilliant mathematician, follows along, even questioning one of Seldon's steps. But Seldon proves his calculation is correct. Finally, he stops. "This," he says, "is Trantor three centuries from now."
</Person1><Person2> And what does Gaal see?
</Person2><Person1> He can barely believe it. The math points to one outcome: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈtoʊtəl dɪˈstrʌkʃən">Total destruction. Seldon explains that as Trantor becomes more specialized and important, it also becomes more <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈvʌlnərəbəl">vulnerable—easier to attack and destroy.
</Person1><Person2> So the city's greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. And Seldon can prove it with math.
</Person2><Person1> Yes. He even asks Gaal to calculate the exact probability. Under pressure, Gaal calculates about an eighty-five percent chance. Seldon corrects him. The actual figure is ninety-two point five percent.
</Person1><Person2> That's... terrifyingly certain.
</Person2><Person1> It is. Gaal finally understands why they call him Raven Seldon, and why this work is a secret. The government cannot let this information get out. Gaal asks if this is why he's being investigated, and Seldon says yes. The young mathematician then asks the most important question: "Are you in danger, sir?"
</Person1><Person2> And that's where we leave them. With this terrible knowledge hanging in the air.
</Person2><Person1> Exactly. Gaal has just learned that the magnificent civilization he dreamed of visiting is doomed, and he is now part of a secret project that could get him killed. And his next meeting is not with Seldon, but with the authorities who have been watching him all along. Next time, Gaal is arrested, and we will see Hari Seldon himself put on trial for predicting the fall of the Empire. I hope you'll join me then. Goodbye for now.</Person1>
