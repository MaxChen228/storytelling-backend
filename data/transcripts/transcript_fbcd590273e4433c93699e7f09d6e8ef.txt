Welcome back to the Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host.  <s>Last time we were together, we left Hober Mallow at a tipping point. <s>He had just laid out his entire strategy to Jorane Sutt, explaining that the Foundation’s true power wasn't in priests or military might, but in economic control—a lesson he learned on Korell. <s>He’s banking everything on the idea that when Korell's technology fails, its people will choose prosperity over war. <s>Now, the final confrontation between these two powerful men has arrived.
Can you just picture the scene? <s>It’s early evening on Terminus. <s>Sutt is standing at the window, his back to Mallow and Jael. <s>He’s not looking at them, but out at the stars on the very edge of the Galaxy. <s>Imagine the tension in that room… a quiet that’s heavier than any shouting match. <s>The stars are described as struggling feebly, which feels like a perfect metaphor for the Foundation’s own position, doesn't it? <s>Fighting for its light against the vast, misty empire.
And then, Sutt finally speaks. <s>And his words are just… ice. "No," he says. "You are not the man." <s>He doesn't trust Mallow. <s>Not one bit. <s>He calls him "smooth-tongued"—which is a great phrase, it means someone who speaks very persuasively, maybe too persuasively, to deceive people. <s>Sutt lists all the times Mallow has outsmarted him: on Korell, during the trial… <s>He accuses Mallow of demagoguery, of using popular passions to gain power. "There is nothing straight about you," he says, "no motive that hasn't another behind it; no statement that hasn't three meanings."
<s>Mmm… you can feel the deep, personal bitterness in that, can't you? <s>Sutt then lays out the ultimate accusation: treason. <s>He suggests that Mallow’s entire plan—strengthening Korell with trade and then provoking a war while keeping the Foundation inactive—is exactly what a traitor paid by the Empire would do. <s>It’s a chilling thought, because Sutt makes it sound so plausible.
<s>And Mallow's response? "You mean there'll be no compromise?" <s>He asks it so gently. <s>It’s such a contrast to Sutt’s rising anger. <s>Sutt’s face literally turns red with emotion as he gives his final warning: arrest him, and Mallow will face a popular uprising. <s>He claims the people of the Foundation have a "consciousness of destiny" that Mallow, a mere trader from Smyrno, could never understand.
<s>But Mallow… Mallow has already made his decision. <s>Quietly, he tells the guards to take Sutt away. <s>Sutt gives him one last chance, but Mallow just… stubs out his cigar. <s>He doesn’t even look up. <s>The finality of that small action is just devastating.
<s>After Sutt is gone, Jael breaks the silence. <s>He’s worried. "Well," he says, "now that you've made a martyr for the cause, what next?" <s>He thinks Mallow has made a huge mistake. <s>But Mallow sees it differently. <s>He says Sutt isn’t the man he used to know; he's become a "blood-blind bull." <s>Let’s pause on that phrase for a moment. <s>A "blood-blind bull"… it paints such a vivid picture of someone so consumed by rage that they can't see or think clearly anymore. <s>They just charge ahead, blindly. <s>Mallow believes Sutt's hatred has made him predictable, not more dangerous.
<s>Jael isn’t convinced. <s>He fears a rebellion. <s>But this is where Mallow reveals the final, brilliant, and perhaps ruthless, piece of his plan. <s>He says Sutt failed because he tried to use religion, a force that is now "played out" in the Seldon Plan. <s>Economics, however, is a different story. <s>He then paraphrases Salvor Hardin, saying, "it's a poor nuclear blaster that won't point both ways."
<s>What does he mean by that? <s>Well, just as Korell's economy depends on the Foundation, the Foundation’s economy now depends on its trade with the outer worlds. <s>And Mallow controls it all. <s>Every factory, every shipping line. <s>His strategy is simple: where Sutt's propaganda starts to succeed, he will squeeze the economy. <s>Prosperity will die. <s>Where people remain loyal to him, business will boom. <s>He is absolutely certain that people will not revolt against their own prosperity. <s>It’s a chillingly effective form of control.
<s>Jael sees the implication immediately. "So then," he says, "you're establishing a plutocracy." <s>A plutocracy, which means a society ruled by the wealthy. <s>He asks, "Then what of the future?"
<s>And Mallow’s reply is just… fierce. "What business of mine is the future?" <s>He fully believes that Seldon has planned for it. <s>He sees his role as solving the crisis of today, using the tools of today—which happen to be money and trade. <s>He says future crises will require new solutions from his successors, just as he had to find a new solution when religion was no longer the answer. <s>It’s an incredibly pragmatic, almost cold, way of looking at history.
<s>And the book tells us… he was right. <s>After three years of what was called the "most unfought war on record," Korell surrenders. <s>And Hober Mallow, the trader, the pragmatist, takes his place beside the great heroes of the Foundation. <s>He won, not with blasters or speeches, but by understanding that, sometimes, the most powerful force in the galaxy is simply the desire for a comfortable life.
It leaves us with so much to think about, doesn’t it? <s>Mallow's methods were manipulative, and he created a system ruled by wealth, but he also saved the Foundation. <s>It truly makes you question what it means to be a hero. <s>Thank you for joining me today. <s>Until next time, happy reading. </Person1>
