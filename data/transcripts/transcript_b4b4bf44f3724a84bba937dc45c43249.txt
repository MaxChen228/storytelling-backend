Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)!
Last time, we left Elend and his army as they arrived at the strong walls of Fadrex City. They knew they could not turn back. The canal was blocked with ash, trapping them there. Now, standing before this powerful city, Elend must make a plan.
Can you picture it? It is night. The air is dark and cool. Elend is outside his tent, looking up at the city. It sits high on rocky cliffs. And up there, he sees bonfires. Bright, blazing fires.
Mmm… often, fires at night are a sign of fear. People light them to keep the scary mists away. But these fires feel different. They burn high and strong, almost like they are floating in the sky. They feel like a warning. A message that says, 'We are not afraid of you. We are confident.'
Elend watches them for a moment. Then, he turns and walks into his commander’s tent. Inside, a small group of his most trusted friends are waiting. Ham is there. Cett is there. And Vin is there. But someone is missing. Demoux is still sick from the mists.
Elend thinks about all his people. He feels they are spread thin.
This is a great phrase. Spread thin. It means your people are in too many different places. You don't have enough strength in any single place. Elend thinks about his other friends. Spook and Breeze are far away in the North. Penrod is back in the capital city, Luthadel. He feels like his team is stretched out, like a rubber band pulled too far.
"All right," Elend says, letting the tent flap close. "Looks like they’re holed up in there pretty well."
Ham gives him the first report from the scouts. "We think there are about twenty-five thousand defenders in the city, El."
Elend is a little surprised. "That’s not as many as I expected," he says.
Cett, the man who used to rule this city, explains. The new king, Yomen, has to keep soldiers in other cities, too. If he brought all his soldiers here, the other cities would rebel.
Vin sounds amused. "You think they would rebel and join your side again?" she asks Cett.
"No," Cett says. "They would rebel and try to become kings themselves!" He explains that now, every small lord with a little bit of power thinks he can rule a kingdom. It’s a new, dangerous time.
Elend agrees. He knows this Yomen is clever. Yomen knows Fadrex City is very strong. He can defend it with fewer soldiers. This lets him keep control of the rest of the kingdom. It also means he has enough supplies to survive a very long siege.
Ham looks worried. "We have to be careful," he says. "Yomen probably has soldiers hiding outside the city, waiting to attack our camp."
Elend immediately makes a plan. "Double the guards," he orders. "Triple the scout patrols. I want them watching all the time, especially in the early morning."
Then, he adds another, cleverer idea. "Tell the men to stay in their tents when the mists are out," he says. "But tell them to be ready for a raid." He hopes Yomen will think they are afraid of the mists. Maybe, just maybe, they can bait Yomen into a surprise attack that isn't a surprise at all.
Ham smiles. "Clever," he says.
But this clever plan doesn't solve their biggest problem. "That won’t get us past those natural walls, though," Elend says. He turns to Cett. "What do you say?"
Cett’s idea is simple and brutal. "Hold the canal," he says. "Then, move on."
Everyone is surprised. Move on?
Elend understands. "Attack the other cities?" he asks. "Leave a small army here and capture the rest of his territory?" Cett nods. He says the other cities are not strong. They would give up without a fight.
It’s a good military suggestion. "But we won’t do it," Elend says firmly.
"Why not?" Cett asks, frustrated.
"This isn’t just about getting your kingdom back, Cett," Elend explains. "Our main reason for coming here is to find that storage cache." He also says he does not want to hurt the people of the countryside. He doesn't want his army to go around pillaging.
Pillaging the countryside. That is our second phrase. Pillaging means to steal things from a place, like a town or a farm, using violence. It often happens in a war. Elend wants to be a different kind of king. He wants to protect people, not hurt them.
Cett just snorts. He doesn't believe in stories or magic. "What do you think is in that cache?" he asks. "Some magical way to stop the ash?" He thinks Elend is chasing a silly puzzle left by the old, evil Lord Ruler.
Cett’s argument is very practical. He says their only real hope is to secure the land in this area. The farms here are on high plateaus, closer to the sun. If any plants can survive the mists and the ash, they will grow here. This is their only real chance to survive.
They are good arguments. For a moment, maybe Elend even doubts himself. But he can't give up. Not yet. He has seen the reports. He knows that more farmland will not save them. The ash is killing everything. They need something else. A miracle. A secret.
He believes the Lord Ruler left them something. He thinks the old king wouldn't want all of his people to die. He left food and water in other caches. So, in this last one, there must be an answer.
There will be something here, Elend thinks to himself. There has to be.
And so, Elend holds onto that small, powerful feeling of hope. He has made his choice. He will not attack the countryside. He will focus on the city, and on the secret inside.
What happens next? Elend must begin the siege. But he will try to use words before he uses swords. He needs more information. And for that, he will turn to Vin. He will ask her to go alone into the mists, a silent ghost, to scout the city and find the path to their only hope. We will join her on that dangerous journey next time.</Person1>
