<Person1>Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Salvor Hardin met the important Lord Dorwin from the Empire. Hardin is worried about danger from other planets. But Lord Dorwin was more interested in old books and the past. He believes reading about history is better than seeing it for yourself. Hardin is starting to see a big problem, and it's not just about books.
</Person1><Person2>Let's join Hardin as he continues his conversation with Lord Dorwin. Imagine the room. It is probably filled with books and maps. Lord Dorwin is talking about a very old book. He says it might show where humans first came from. He seems very excited about this ancient mystery. But Hardin is thinking about the present, about today's dangers.
</Person2><Person1>Hardin asks a simple question. "When was this book written?" Lord Dorwin thinks for a moment. "Oh, about eight hundred years ago," he says. He adds that the book is based on even older work. So, Hardin asks another smart question. "Why not go to the planet yourself? Why not see the evidence with your own eyes?"
</Person1><Person2>Lord Dorwin is shocked. Mmm… he thinks this is a silly idea. He says the "scientific method" is to read what the old masters wrote. You compare their books, find the disagreements, and decide what is probably true. He thinks going to a planet and looking around is… well, a crude and messy way to learn. It’s like he trusts paper more than reality. What do you think of his method?
</Person2><Person1>Hardin just says, "I see." He is polite, but we can guess what he is really thinking. He sees that this great lord from the Empire lives in the past. He is not focused on the real world. As they are leaving, Hardin asks one more question. It seems random. He asks about a power plant that broke down on another planet. He wants to know the details.
</Person1><Person2>Dr. Pirenne, the head of the Board, is annoyed. He thinks Hardin is wasting the lord's time. But Lord Dorwin doesn't mind. He says yes, it was a terrible accident. He also shares a secret. The government is thinking about limiting nuclear power. It is becoming too dangerous. This is a big piece of information.
</Person2><Person1>Hardin keeps asking. "But what was wrong with the plant?" Lord Dorwin just shrugs. He says it's hard to find people who understand the technology anymore. The repairs were probably not very good. Think about that for a second. The great Galactic Empire… is forgetting how its own machines work. It is losing its knowledge, its power. This is the real problem Hardin sees.
</Person1><Person2>He then points out that the planets around them, the "barbarous" kingdoms, have lost nuclear power completely. Lord Dorwin isn't surprised. He thinks they are not civilized. He believes the Empire is still strong because they have treaties, or special agreements. But Hardin knows that a piece of paper is not the same as real power.
</Person2><Person1>So, in this first part, Hardin learns two very important things. One: The Empire's leaders care more about ancient history than today's problems. Two: The Empire is getting weaker. It is losing the amazing technology that made it so powerful. This is a dangerous situation for Terminus.
</Person1><Person2>Now, the story jumps forward a little. Hardin is at another meeting with the Board of Trustees. But he feels something is wrong. He thinks they have had other meetings without him. They didn't invite him. They don't trust him. And why are they meeting now? Because of a message. A message from the King of Anacreon.
</Person2><Person1>The message looks very fancy. It has beautiful colors and fancy words. It calls Dr. Pirenne a "friend and brother." But Hardin knows what it really is. It is an ultimatum. Let's talk about that word. An ultimatum. An ultimatum is a final demand. It is when someone says, "You must do what I ask by a certain time. If you don't, there will be bad consequences." It's a threat hidden in polite language.
</Person1><Person2>Hardin tells the board they have only one week. One week to respond to this ultimatum. Pirenne is worried. He still trusts Lord Dorwin's promises of help from the Empire. In fact, he told the King of Anacreon that the Empire would protect Terminus. Hardin just gives a small, sour smile. He thinks that was a big mistake. He believes telling the king about the Empire is exactly why they received the ultimatum so quickly.
</Person2><Person1>The other board members are confused. They ask Hardin how he knows this. He says he used something called symbolic logic. That sounds complicated, right? But Hardin explains it in a simple way. He says it's a tool to find the real meaning in words. It cuts away all the polite, fancy language that doesn't mean anything.
</Person1><Person2>He shows them a piece of paper. A logic expert helped him. The expert took the long, fancy message from the king and used symbols to find its true meaning. And the meaning was very simple and very scary. It was, "You give us what we want in a week, or we take it by force." There was no "friend and brother" in that message. It was a clear threat.
</Person2><Person1>The board members are silent. They see the symbols. They understand. There is no loophole, no way out. But Hardin isn't finished. (soft laugh) He has another paper. It's the big, important treaty between Anacreon and the Empire. The same treaty Lord Dorwin signed.
</Person1><Person2>The treaty is five pages long, full of difficult legal words. But Hardin also has a symbolic analysis of the treaty. And that analysis is less than half a page. What did it say? Hardin explains that ninety percent of the treaty was just meaningless words. It boiled right out. The real meaning was something very different from what they all believed.
</Person2><Person1>So, Hardin has shown the Board the truth. The friendly message is a threat. And the powerful treaty protecting them… is mostly empty. They are in serious danger. And they have only one week. Hardin has used logic and common sense to see the reality that everyone else missed because they were trusting old ideas and fancy words.
</Person1><Person2>What will happen now? In our next chapter, Hardin will reveal the treaty's biggest secret. He will show everyone that Lord Dorwin, the great diplomat, said absolutely nothing of value. The Foundation is truly alone. With only six days until the mysterious Vault opens, they must decide: do they fight, do they surrender, or do they trust in a plan made fifty years ago? The choice will change everything.</Person2>
