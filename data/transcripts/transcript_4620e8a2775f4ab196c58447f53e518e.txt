<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we left off on such a dramatic note, didn't we? Hober Mallow, once on trial for his life, masterfully turned the tables on his accusers, exposing a Korellian plot and seizing control of the Foundation in one brilliant move. But now, with power firmly in his hands, the real challenge begins. What is he going to do about Korell? 
</Person1><Person2> The story picks up right in that moment of tension. Imagine the scene: Mallow is with his loyal friend, Ankor Jael. Jael, his brow furrowed with worry, asks the question on everyone's mind: "What's it going to be? Korell, after all?" 
</Person2><Person1> And Mallow's answer is so calm, so certain. He just nods. "Of course." He predicts they'll declare war, but not for a couple more years. But Jael is thinking about their power. He asks, "With nuclear ships?" 
</Person1><Person2> Mmm, and this is where Mallow drops a bombshell. He reveals something huge, something that changes the entire game. He tells Jael that Korell isn't just building these ships themselves. They're getting them… from the Empire. 
</Person2><Person1> The Galactic Empire! Can you believe it? The very same Empire everyone thought was collapsing and gone, at least out here in the Periphery. Mallow insists it's still very much alive at the center of the galaxy. It’s this colossal, looming threat in the background. One wrong move, he says, and the full weight of the Empire could come down on them. 
</Person1><Person2> It’s a terrifying thought. And that, Mallow explains, is why he must be in charge. He claims he's the only one who knows how to handle this crisis. So Jael, swallowing nervously, asks the logical next question: "How? What are you going to do?" 
</Person2><Person1> And Mallow’s answer is just… baffling. He says one word: "Nothing." 
</Person1><Person2> Nothing! Jael just smiles, totally confused. After all that, after seizing power, his grand plan is to do nothing? But Mallow is dead serious. He says, "One hundred percent of nothing, and that is the secret of this crisis." It's such a mysterious and confident statement. What could he possibly mean? 
</Person2><Person1> Well, to understand the other side of this conflict, the story whisks us away to Korell, into the court of its leader, Commdor Asper Argo. And the picture it paints is… not very impressive. He’s greeted by his wife, and the book says he has a "hangdog lowering of his scanty eyebrows." 
</Person1><Person2> That's a wonderful phrase, isn't it? A "hangdog" expression. It means he looks sad, guilty, almost ashamed… like a dog that knows it did something wrong. It immediately tells you he’s not a very powerful or confident man, especially around his wife. 
</Person2><Person1> Exactly. And she is the complete opposite. Her voice is described as "as sleek as her hair and as cold as her eyes." She is ambitious, sharp, and clearly impatient with her husband's weakness. She scorns his advisors, calling them a "herd of palsied purblind idiots." She is pushing, pushing, pushing for war. 
</Person1><Person2> She's furious that it's been three years since Mallow's visit, and they still haven't attacked the Foundation. She taunts him, saying just one of their ships could blast the Foundation into "stinking rubble." She sees the Foundation as just a collection of traders selling "toys and trash." 
</Person2><Person1> The Commdor, for his part, seems tired. He complains that her father—who is clearly the real power behind the throne—has been cheap, or "niggardly," with supplying more ships. But in the end, her constant pressure works. He finally gives in. 
</Person1><Person2> Mmmhmm. He tells her, with deep weariness, "I am growing old… It is over, and there is war between Korell and the Foundation." She is thrilled. She imagines them leaving this "barbarous world" and joining the high society of the Empire's court. 
</Person2><Person1> But as she sweeps out of the room, full of triumph, the Commdor whispers to the closed door with so much hate. He dreams of the day when he's powerful enough to get rid of her and her arrogant father. It’s a palace full of poison and ambition. 
</Person1><Person2> And then, suddenly, war becomes real. The story jumps to a Foundation ship, the Dark Nebula. Its lieutenant is staring at the viewscreen in absolute horror. He sees an enemy ship, but it's a whale to their minnow—a giant. And on its side is the symbol of the Empire. The threat Mallow warned about is no longer a theory. It's right there. 
</Person2><Person1> The ship sends a desperate warning back to the Foundation. And we jump forward two years. Mallow is now the Mayor, buried in government reports. The war has begun, but it seems to be a quiet one so far. A few ships have been lost, but Mallow calls it "just a scratch." 
</Person1><Person2> But Ankor Jael is deeply worried, not about the war, but about politics at home. He tells Mallow, "you've never given a care about what goes on here on the home planet." A politician named Jorane Sutt, the leader of the Religionists, is gaining power. Jael is afraid Sutt will force a new election and have Mallow thrown out. 
</Person2><Person1> Jael is frustrated because Mallow's strategy has no glamour. It lacks what he calls "mob emotion-appeal." That’s another great phrase. It means it doesn’t have that spark, that passion that gets a large crowd excited and on your side. Mallow’s plan is to retreat, to abandon trade, to accept a stalemate. It looks weak. 
</Person1><Person2> Mallow seems completely unfazed. He agrees to meet with Sutt, to try and find a compromise. The meeting is icy. Sutt’s terms are simple and absolute: Mallow must abandon his policy of trade and return to the old ways of conquest by missionary. Spreading the Foundation's religion. 
</Person2><Person1> Mallow, calmly smoking a cigar, points out the irony. He says that in the past, people like Sutt opposed that very strategy because it was new and radical. Now, because it's old and tested, Sutt loves it. Then he asks Sutt a critical question: how would you handle this war? 
</Person1><Person2> Sutt’s answer is exactly what you’d expect: a strong offensive. He argues that Mallow's stalemate is a confession of weakness that will invite every other power in the Periphery to attack them. 
</Person2><Person1> But Mallow lays the final trap. He asks, what about after you beat Korell? "What of the Empire? That is the real enemy." And that is where we leave them, at this crucial impasse. Mallow is fighting a war on two fronts: an external one against Korell and the shadow of the Empire, and an internal one against Sutt's popular political movement. His only stated plan is to do nothing, a plan that nobody understands or supports. 
</Person1><Person2> It seems like an impossible situation. How can "doing nothing" possibly be a winning strategy? Well, it turns out Mallow's plan is far more subtle than anyone realizes. His strategy is a new kind of weapon, one forged from his deep understanding of economics and the Empire's hidden weaknesses. Next time, we will finally uncover the secret of his plan, and learn why sometimes, the most powerful action… is inaction. </Person2>
