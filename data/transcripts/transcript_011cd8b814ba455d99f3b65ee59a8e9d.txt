<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left Vin and Elend in their tent. They made a promise. A promise of complete trust. They cannot speak their plans aloud, because the evil force, Ruin, can hear everything. Vin has a secret plan to save the world. And Elend has promised to help, even if he doesn't understand. Now, let’s join them again.
Imagine them sitting close together. The world outside is gray with ash. But inside their tent, there is a small moment of warmth. Elend looks at Vin, and he smiles a little. He starts to speak, and his voice is gentle, but also teasing.
"You know," he says, "you have to admit you are unusual, Vin." He says she is like a strange mix of three things. A noblewoman... a street urchin... and a cat. (soft laugh) It’s a funny description, isn't it? It shows how complex Vin is. She can be elegant like a noble. She can be tough like a child from the streets. And she can be quiet and mysterious, like a cat.
Let's talk about that phrase, a street urchin. An urchin is a poor child, one who often has no home or family. They live on the streets. This was Vin's life before she met her friends. She had to be very strong and clever to survive. So when Elend says this, he is remembering her past. But he says it with love. He is not just teasing her. He is also telling her that he sees all of her. The noblewoman she has become, and the street urchin she once was.
He continues to joke. He lists all the important people in his life that Vin... well, that Vin has been connected to when they died. His god, his father, his brother. It's a dark joke, but it shows how much they have been through together.
Vin just rolls her eyes. She is used to Elend's strange sense of humor.
Elend becomes serious again. He tells her that he stopped worrying about how strange she seemed. He realized something very important. He says, "I realized that it didn’t really matter if I understood you, because I trusted you." Mmm. That is the core of their relationship, isn't it? Trust. He tells her again, right now, that he trusts her. He doesn't know her plan. He has no idea how she will save the world. But he believes she can do it.
This is what Vin needed to hear. She moves closer to him. But Elend wishes he could do more. He wants to help her. Vin has an idea for him. She talks about the numbers. Remember the mists that were making people sick? Vin noticed something strange about the numbers, the percentages. But Vin... she does not like numbers. She finds them difficult. So, she asks Elend to work on it. It’s a small task, but it’s a way for him to help.
But there is a rule. A very important rule. "Just don’t tell me what you discover," Vin says. Elend is confused. How can that help? Vin says one word. "Trust." They must work separately, in secret, so Ruin cannot understand their full plan. It is like they are building a puzzle, but each person only has a few pieces. They hope that Ruin cannot see the final picture.
Elend agrees. He promised to trust her. So he will.
Then, their conversation turns to the city they are outside. The city of Fadrex. Elend has an army outside this city. He is the emperor, and he needs to get inside. The city is led by a man named Yomen. Elend wrote a letter to Yomen, hoping to talk. Hoping for peace. But Elend feels frustrated. He clenches his fist. He knows Yomen will probably say no.
This is Elend's big problem. He doesn't want to fight. He has an army of twenty thousand monsters, the koloss, waiting outside. He could use them to attack the city. But he is afraid. He remembers another leader who used the koloss, and it was a disaster. Many innocent people died. Elend doesn't want to be that kind of ruler. He doesn't want to destroy the city's food and let people starve. He feels trapped. He has all this power, but using it feels wrong. What would you do, if you were in his place? It’s a very hard decision.
He looks at Vin, his face full of worry. And then, Vin gets a look in her eyes. A spark. She has an idea. A very, very Vin idea.
"They’re still staging balls inside the city," she says. Balls... you know, those are big, fancy parties where nobles dance. She says the king, Yomen, attends every single one.
Elend just blinks. He doesn't understand at first. But then he sees the look in her eyes. It's a look that reminds him of their old friend, Kelsier. Bold. Brave. Maybe a little bit reckless.
"Vin," he says slowly, "did you just suggest that we attend a ball... being held in the middle of a city we’re besieging?"
Let's pause on that word, besieging. When an army is besieging a city, it means they have surrounded it. No one can come in, and no one can go out. The goal is to make the city surrender. So, Vin’s idea is to secretly go inside the enemy city... to go to a party.
Vin just shrugs. Why not? They are both Mistborn. They have magical powers. They can get into the city easily.
And as Elend thinks about it... the crazy idea starts to sound... brilliant. (chuckle) It's completely unexpected. He could be in a room with all the enemy nobles. He could finally meet Yomen, the man who refuses to see him. Yomen couldn't run away without looking like a coward.
"It’s a crazy idea," Elend says. But then he smiles. "I will admit, however, that the concept does have considerable charm."
So, they decide. If the king won't come to them, they will go to him. They will crash his party. To crash a party means to go without an invitation. It’s a fun phrase for a very dangerous plan.
They are excited now. It feels like an adventure from one of Elend’s books. But then, Vin suddenly grows pale. Her face is filled with horror. Elend is worried. Is it an assassin? Is Ruin nearby?
"I just realized something," Vin says, her eyes wide. "I can’t go to a ball—I didn’t bring a gown!"
(soft laugh) After all that serious planning, that is her biggest problem. A dress for the party.
So, Vin and Elend have a wonderfully crazy plan. But they are not the only ones on a mission. Next time, we will follow their friend, Sazed. He is traveling to a different city, Urteau. It is a place known for its rebellion and its danger. Sazed is going as an ambassador, but he may not get a warm welcome. We will see what happens when he arrives.
