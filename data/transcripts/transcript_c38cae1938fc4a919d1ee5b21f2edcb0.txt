<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, Elend and his friends were feeling very worried. They knew they needed the brave spirit of their old leader, Kelsier, to face the darkness. Now, let’s see what happens next.
</Person1><Person1> Imagine the room. It is quiet, and the air is heavy. Everyone is looking at Elend. He sees their tired faces, their sad eyes. He knows he must give them hope. He takes a breath and begins to speak. He tells them that what happened was a sad event. But he says, “We can survive this.”
</Person1><Person1> He believes they can win. But, there is one very important thing they must do. He says the people need leaders who can laugh. They need leaders who feel that this fight can be won. This is a difficult thing to ask, isn't it? They all feel so much fear inside.
</Person1><Person1> Then, Elend says something truly amazing. He says he doesn't care if they are an optimist or a pessimist. An optimist is a person who always expects good things to happen. A pessimist is a person who expects bad things to happen. Elend says it doesn’t matter how they feel inside. Secretly, they might think they will all be gone in a month. But on the outside, he says, “I want to see you smiling.”
</Person1><Person1> Mmm… smiling when you feel like crying. Why would he ask that? He explains. He tells them to do it in defiance. Let’s talk about that word, 'defiance'. Defiance is when you refuse to obey or to give up. It is a way of showing you are strong, even when a situation is very bad. So, to smile in defiance means using your smile as a kind of protest. It’s a way to tell the world, and your enemies, that you are not broken. It is a small act of great courage.
</Person1><Person1> Elend wants them to meet the end smiling, just like their leader, the Survivor, taught them. And as he speaks, something changes in the room. Slowly, one by one, the members of the crew start to nod their heads. They understand. Even Sazed, who looks very troubled, agrees.
</Person1><Person1> Vin looks at Elend, and she nods, too. She thinks it was a good speech. Mmm… she knows things can’t be the same as they were in the beginning. They can’t go back to laughing freely around a table. But maybe, just maybe, if they remember Kelsier’s smile, they will remember why they must keep fighting.
</Person1><Person1> With this new feeling in the room, Elend is ready. “All right, people,” he says. His voice is strong now. “Let’s start preparations.” He gives everyone a job to do. Sazed and Breeze must plan for their trip. Ham needs to send a message to Luthadel. Demoux has to tell the soldiers. There is no more time for sadness. There is only time for action. Elend’s final words are full of purpose: “We march tomorrow.”
</Person1><Person1> So, in this chapter, we learned a powerful lesson. Leadership is not always about making plans or winning battles. Sometimes, it is about giving people hope. It is about showing strength on the outside, even when you feel weak on the inside. It’s about smiling in defiance.
</Person1><Person1> But they will need every bit of that strength. Because next time, our story will take us to a very different, much darker place. We will be with a man named Marsh. He is an Inquisitor, and he is trapped, feeling Ruin's power all around him. He feels he has failed in the past. But in his despair, he finds a new, dangerous idea. A plan of sacrifice that could disrupt everything. A plan that might be his only way to fight back. Thank you for listening. Goodbye for now.</Person1>
