<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Hari Seldon shocked the entire courtroom. He told them the great Galactic Empire was going to end. Everyone was silent, waiting to see what would happen next. Now, Seldon continues to speak, and his words are even more frightening.
</Person1><Person2>I can only imagine the tension in that room. What does he say will happen after the Empire falls?
</Person2><Person1>He paints a very dark picture. He speaks firmly, with a strong voice. He says, "The Empire will vanish and all its good with it." Think about that for a moment. All the good things... gone.
</Person1><Person2>Vanish? What exactly does he mean by that?
</Person2><Person1>Mmm, that's a great question. Let's look at that word, 'vanish'. It means to disappear completely. Like a cloud of smoke that just... fades away into the air until you can't see it anymore. Seldon is saying the Empire won't just get smaller or weaker. It will be completely gone.
</Person1><Person2>That sounds terrible. So, no more Empire, no more order?
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. He says knowledge will decay, which means it will break down and be lost. Trade between planets will stop. People will fight endless wars. Worlds will become lonely and separated. It sounds like a very dark time.
</Person1><Person2>A dark time... for how long?
</Person2><Person1>Someone in the court asks that same question. In the huge, silent room, a small voice asks, "Forever?" And Seldon's answer is shocking. He says these dark ages will last for thirty... thousand... years.
</Person1><Person2>Thirty thousand years! That's an incredible amount of time. Is there any hope at all?
</Person2><Person1>There is. This is the center of Seldon's plan. He tells the court, "We must fight that." He explains that his project, his big group of people, can't stop the Empire from falling. But, he says, they can make the dark time shorter.
</Person1><Person2>So he can change the future, just a little bit?
</Person2><Person1>Yes, just a little. He says they can reduce the thirty thousand years of suffering to just one thousand years. Imagine that. Saving twenty-nine thousand years of misery. It's like a giant ship heading for a rock. You can't stop the ship, but maybe you can turn the wheel just a tiny bit. A small change now can make a huge difference later.
</Person1><Person2>And how does he plan to do that? With an army?
</Person2><Person1>Not with an army. With knowledge. He plans to save all of human knowledge in one giant work. He calls it the "Encyclopedia Galactica." The idea is that if all knowledge is in one place, future generations won't have to rediscover everything. They can build on what came before. It’s like saving seeds from a beautiful garden before a long winter. The garden will be gone, but with the seeds, you can grow a new one much faster when spring comes.
</Person1><Person2>So, the Encyclopedia is the seed for a new civilization. That's a beautiful idea. How does the court react to this?
</Person2><Person1>The judge, the Chief Commissioner, ends the trial. Seldon sits down next to Gaal and smiles. He asks Gaal, "How did you like the show?" Gaal is amazed. But he's also worried about what will happen next. Seldon thinks the Commission will try to make a private deal with him.
</Person1><Person2>A private deal? Not a public trial anymore?
</Person2><Person1>That's right. The next day, everything is different. It's just Seldon, Gaal, and the five judges in a small, private room. There are no guards standing between them. It feels less like a trial and more like a... a business meeting. They even offer them cigars from a strange, beautiful box that looks like it's made of flowing water.
</Person1><Person2>Who leads this meeting? Is it the judge from before?
</Person2><Person1>The real power is a man named Linge Chen. The book says he is the actual Emperor of the Galaxy. He is the one who truly holds the power. Chen tells Seldon that he is disturbing the peace. He asks a cold question: Why should he care about something that will happen in three hundred years? He says, "Why may I not... have you executed tonight?"
</Person1><Person2>Wow. He just threatens to kill him right there?
</Person2><Person1>Yes. It's a very tense moment. But Seldon is calm. He tells Chen that killing him would be a very bad idea. It would make things worse, much faster. He explains that if he is killed, the news will spread. People will lose all hope. The Empire won't fall in three hundred years; it will fall in fifty. And Chen himself would be dead in one year.
</Person1><Person2>He's using his own death as a threat. That's clever.
</Person2><Person1>Very clever. Chen sees that Seldon is not easily scared. So, he offers him a choice. Not death... but something else. He asks Seldon if his work on the Encyclopedia has to be done on Trantor, the capital planet.
</Person1><Person2>I see where this is going. He wants them to leave.
</Person2><Person1>Precisely. Chen offers them a new home. A planet far, far away where they can work in peace. He says they can have their own world, just for the Encyclopedia project. But it's not really a kind offer. It's a command.
</Person1><Person2>What is this choice he offers?
</Person2><Person1>The choice is simple and terrible. They can go to this new planet, or they can die. Chen calls it 'exile'. Let's pause on that word. Exile is when you are forced to leave your home, your country, and you cannot return. It is a punishment. They are being sent away so they cannot cause any more trouble for the Emperor's peace.
</Person1><Person2>And which planet has he chosen for them?
</Person2><Person1>A planet called Terminus. Seldon immediately knows where it is. He says, "It is at the edge of the Galaxy, sir." It's a remote, lonely place. Chen gives him only five minutes to decide.
</Person1><Person2>Five minutes to decide the fate of a hundred thousand people. What does Seldon do?
</Person2><Person1>After a long moment of thought, with time running out, Seldon looks at Chen. He says, "I accept exile." Gaal is filled with joy because they are safe from death. But he also feels a little sad. He feels that his great hero, Hari Seldon, has been defeated.
</Person1><Person2>So they are safe, but they have lost. They have to leave their homes and go to the very end of the universe. It feels like a sad ending.
</Person2><Person1>It does feel that way, doesn't it? A defeat. But with Hari Seldon, things are not always what they seem. Gaal thinks Seldon has lost, but did he? (pause) Next time, we will discover that this exile, this defeat, might have been Seldon's secret plan all along. Join us then.</Person1>
