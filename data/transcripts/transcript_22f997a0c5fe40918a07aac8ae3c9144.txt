<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we left Vin at a fancy party. She had just walked up to the most powerful noblewoman in the room. And she sat down at her table, even though no one invited her. Vin was there to cause trouble, to make people feel unsafe. Now, let’s see what she does next.
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… picture the scene. Vin is sitting with these rich, important women. The air is very tense. Everyone is watching. Vin is calm, but she is also very dangerous. She starts by using her special powers, her Allomancy. But she doesn't push on metal. No, she gives a careful Push on the emotions of the women at the table. She makes them feel more worried, more afraid. It’s a very quiet, very secret way to take control.
</Person1><Person1>She tells them, “I’ve got your entire city under threat already.” Can you imagine? The main woman, the leader, she narrows her eyes at Vin. When you ‘narrow your eyes,’ it means you squeeze them a little. It shows you are angry, or you don't trust someone. The woman tells the others, “Don’t listen to her.” But one of the other women is nervous. She speaks too quickly and says the leader's name. “Yes, Lady Patresen.”
</Person1><Person1>Ah! Now Vin knows her name. Patresen. Vin thinks, Do I know that name? And then she speaks out loud, very casually. She connects the name Patresen to another famous family, the Elariels. Lady Patresen stays quiet. She doesn't say a word. This silence is very important. It tells Vin she is right.
</Person1><Person1>And then Vin says something truly scary. She says, “I killed an Elariel once.” She leans in closer to the table. She tells Lady Patresen that the stories about her are true. She really did kill the Lord Ruler. It wasn't just propaganda. Propaganda is when leaders tell stories to make people believe something, even if it's not totally true. Vin is saying, “Believe it.”
</Person1><Person1>Then, Vin’s words get even colder. She tells Lady Patresen that she is not important. Ouch. She says, “You are not my adversary.” An adversary is an enemy, someone you fight against. Vin is saying that Lady Patresen is not even a real enemy to her. She is just a ‘petty woman’ in a small city. ‘Petty’ is a great word here. It means someone who cares too much about small, unimportant things. Vin is telling her, “Your plans and your power? They mean nothing to me.”
</Person1><Person1>This is all a warning. Vin makes it very clear. “We’re going to take this city,” she says. And when they do, there will be no room for people who were against them. Lady Patresen’s face becomes pale, which means she loses some color because she is scared. But her voice is calm. She tries to be strong. She says that if Vin could take the city easily, she would have done it already.
</Person1><Person1>But Vin has an answer. She explains that her husband, Elend, is a man of honor. He wanted to talk first. But then Vin adds, “I, however, am not quite so temperate.” Temperate means calm and controlled. Vin is saying she is not as patient as her husband. She is ready to fight.
</Person1><Person1>She can see Lady Patresen still doesn’t understand how serious this is. So Vin lists her army’s numbers. Forty thousand men. Twenty thousand koloss. And two Mistborn—her and Elend. That is a huge, terrifying army. Vin says, “We came to give a warning. I suggest you take it.”
</Person1><Person1>And to finish her point, she does something amazing. She uses a powerful Soothing on the women. Soothing is an Allomantic power that makes people feel calm and happy. But here, Vin uses it to show her strength. She wants them to feel her power, to know that she can control their emotions completely. It's not a kind gesture; it's a threat.
</Person1><Person1>Then, she just… stands up and walks away. (soft laugh) She thinks the important thing was just to be seen talking to Lady Patresen. She hopes it will make other people at the party feel safer to talk to her. But then… she hears chairs moving behind her. She turns around. And what she sees is a complete surprise.
</Person1><Person1>Most of the women who were with Lady Patresen are walking toward Vin. They left their leader sitting all alone at the table. Can you picture Lady Patresen’s face? She must be so angry and embarrassed. The women come to Vin. One of them asks very quietly, “Perhaps you would let some of us… introduce you at the party?”
</Person1><Person1>Vin is shocked. She blinks in surprise. She expected them to hate her or fear her from a distance. She did not expect them to follow her! They look so intimidated, so scared, but they still came to her. Feeling a little confused, but seeing her chance, Vin just nods her head. And she lets these noblewomen lead her into the party.
</Person1><Person1>So, in just a few minutes, Vin completely changed the power at that party. She didn't just scare one woman; she broke apart her group of friends and made them want to join her side. It shows us that Vin’s power isn't only in fighting. It’s in her words, her confidence, and her ability to understand and control people.
</Person1><Person1>Now, while Vin is navigating the politics of a high-society party, our story takes us to a very different place. We will go to the city of Urteau, to a hidden place deep underground. There, we will find Sazed, Breeze, and Spook. They are also facing a difficult leader, a tyrant named Quellion. They need a plan. But they don't all agree on what to do. Will they choose a path of violence, or something else? We will find out what they decide in our next chapter.</Person1>
