Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we talked about the author, and how after many years, he finally agreed to write a new story for his famous Foundation series. He was ready to return to his universe.
And today… (pause) today we open the book. We are finally stepping into the world of the Galactic Empire. It all begins with a short piece from a future history book, the Encyclopedia Galactica. It tells us about a man named Hari Seldon. He was born thousands of years in the future, and he was a genius in mathematics. He created a new science called psychohistory. Mmm… psychohistory. It’s the idea that you can use math to understand the future of all humanity. A very big idea.
But the story doesn't start with this famous man. Instead, we meet someone new. His name is Gaal Dornick. The book tells us he is just a country boy. He has never seen the great city-planet of Trantor before. Trantor is the center of the whole galaxy, the heart of the Empire. Imagine a government that rules over twenty-five million planets. That’s how big this Empire is.
Gaal is from a small planet at the edge of the galaxy. But he is very smart. He has a doctorate in mathematics. And he has an invitation from the great Hari Seldon himself. He is going to Trantor to join a special group called the Seldon Project. For a young, smart man like Gaal, this trip is the most important moment of his life.
Let’s imagine being with Gaal on the spaceship. It’s a huge, shiny ship, a product of twelve thousand years of progress. He has been in space before, so he’s not scared. But he has never traveled this far. He has never made a Jump through hyperspace. Hyperspace is a strange place. It is not space or time, not energy or matter. It’s the only way to travel between stars quickly.
Gaal is a little nervous for the first Jump. He waits… (pause) and then there is just a tiny little kick inside him. It’s over before he is even sure it happened. He’s a little disappointed. He expected something… more.
After the Jump, he spends his time in the View-room, looking out the window. He wants to see everything. He watches the bright stars. He sees a star cluster, which looks like a giant group of fire-flies, frozen in the sky. Then, a beautiful blue-white nebula appears. It fills the window like spilled milk and makes the room feel cold.
But there is one thing he wants to see more than anything: the planet Trantor. He watches its sun get bigger and brighter with every Jump. Finally, an officer comes in and says the View-room is closing. They are preparing to land.
Gaal is so disappointed. He quickly goes to the officer. He asks, “Would it be possible to let me stay? I would like to see Trantor.” He feels a little shy. He worries that the officer can hear his accent, that he sounds like a country boy.
Let’s stop here for our language spotlight. Gaal worries he speaks with a provincial accent (地方口音). The word ‘provincial’ means something is from the countryside, far away from the main city. A provincial accent is a way of speaking that shows you are not from the capital. It makes Gaal feel small and like he doesn't belong.
The officer smiles kindly. But he says no. He explains that the ship is landing on the side facing the sun. It’s too bright and dangerous. "Trantor would only be a gray blur anyway," he says. He tells Gaal to take a space-tour after he lands. Gaal feels like a child. He tried to be an adult, a doctor of mathematics, but in this moment, he just feels a deep, childish disappointment. He had dreamed of seeing Trantor from space, and now he has to wait even longer.
The ship finally lands. There are so many noises. The hiss of the atmosphere, the drone of the engines, and the sounds of thousands of people getting ready to leave. Gaal gets his visa stamped. But he isn't paying attention. He is looking around. This is Trantor! The air feels thicker. Gravity feels stronger.
He steps into the Debarkation Building, and it is… huge. So huge. The roof is so high he can't really see it. He can't see the opposite wall. There are just people and desks, stretching on and on until they disappear. He wonders if he will ever get used to the immensity (巨大) of this place.
And that brings us to our second word: immensity. It means something is so big, it’s hard to understand. The building is immense. The city is immense. Gaal feels very, very small. An annoyed man at a desk tells him where to find a taxi, and Gaal walks away, looking for a sign that says "TAXIS TO ALL POINTS."
So, our chapter ends with Gaal’s arrival. He is a brilliant young man from a small world, now standing at the very center of the galaxy. He has felt the quiet disappointment of a missed opportunity, and now he feels the overwhelming size of his new home. He is excited, but also a little lost.
What will happen to this country boy in the biggest city in the universe? Next time, Gaal will try to find his way through Trantor. We will discover what this planet-city really looks like from the outside. Is there any nature? Is there an open sky? And most importantly… is someone following him? Join us next time to find out.
