<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we learned the mists are changing. They feel… wrong. No longer a safe place for Vin. Elend decided his army must face the dangerous mists to become stronger. Now, the army is packing up. They are getting ready to leave. And Vin has a very strange conversation.
</Person1><Person1> Can you picture it? The camp is busy. Most of the tents are down and packed away. Soldiers are eating their food very quickly. It’s a gray, ashy morning. Vin walks away from the noise. And there, she finds someone sitting alone. His name is Human.
</Person1><Person1> But… he is not a normal human. He is a koloss. He is huge… eleven feet tall! His skin is a strange blue color, and his muscles are very, very big. His face looks broken. The skin is ripped from his eye down to his mouth. It is bleeding. He has small, red eyes. Even Vin, who is so brave, feels a little scared when she looks at him. Mmm… she knows she controls him, but he is still a massive beast.
</Person1><Person1> "Human," she says to him. He looks at her and slowly stands up. Ash falls from his giant blue body. Vin shakes off her fear. "Why did you come to camp?" she asks. He speaks slowly and carefully. "I am human," he says. Vin looks at him. "You’re koloss," she says. "You know that."
</Person1><Person1> Human looks at the soldiers' tents. "I should have a house," he says. "Like those." Vin explains, "Those are tents, not houses. You can’t come here. You have to stay with the other koloss." She tells him this because he makes the people in the camp… uncomfortable.
</Person1><Person1> And here, let’s talk about that word, uncomfortable. Uncomfortable is when you feel not relaxed. Maybe you feel a little worried, or nervous. The soldiers feel very uncomfortable when the giant, blue koloss is near them. They are scared of him.
</Person1><Person1> Human says something very smart and very sad. He says the soldiers should attack him if they are uncomfortable. Vin replies, "That’s why you’re not a human. We don’t attack people just because they make us uncomfortable." But Human looks at her. "No," he says. "You make us kill them instead."
</Person1><Person1> Wow. Think about that. He means humans use the koloss to kill people who make them uncomfortable. Vin stops. She has no answer. Then, Human says something that truly surprises her. He looks at her and says, "You’re one of us. You’re like us. Not like them." "Why?" Vin asks. Human looks down at her. "Mist," he says.
</Person1><Person1> Vin feels a sudden chill. The mists. What does he mean? She asks him what the koloss think of the mists. Do they fear them? Do the mists kill them? Human’s logic is simple. "Swords kill," he says. "Rain doesn’t kill. Ash doesn’t kill. Mist doesn’t kill." A year ago, Vin would agree. But now… things are different.
</Person1><Person1> Then Human says two words. "I hate it." He is talking about the mist. "I hate it because it hates me," he says. He looks right at Vin. "You feel it." And Vin is surprised by her own answer. "Yes," she says, quietly. "I do."
</Person1><Person1> The huge koloss just nods, as if he understands. And in that moment, Vin finally accepts a truth she has been avoiding for a long time. The mists are her enemy. Let's look at that word, enemy. An enemy is someone, or something, that wants to hurt you. It is the opposite of a friend. For Vin, the mists are now an enemy.
</Person1><Person1> She starts to remember things. A long time ago, she used the mists' power to fight the Lord Ruler. But she could never do it again. She remembers the mist spirit, too. It was real. It tried to kill Elend… but then it saved him. And now, the mists pull away from her. They kill people. Human was right. The mists hate her.
</Person1><Person1> So, this conversation with a scary koloss helps Vin see the truth. The mists are not just strange weather. They are alive, and they are against her. This is a very big, and very frightening, moment for Vin. What will she do now that she knows her old friend is her new enemy?
</Person1><Person1> Next time, our story will take us to a new city. We will meet a man named Spook. His senses are so powerful that normal light and sound are painful for him. He is preparing for a big conflict in his city. What is his story, and what danger is coming? We will find out. Thank you for listening to the Storytelling Series. See you next time.</Person1>
