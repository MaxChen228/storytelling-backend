<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we learned that Mayor Salvor Hardin is a very clever man. For thirty years, he has protected his small world of scientists. But now, he faces a new problem from inside his own city. A group of young, angry politicians, led by a man named Sef Sermak, have come to his office. Let's see what they want.
</Person1><Person2>Can you picture the scene? Mayor Hardin is sitting calmly. The four young men enter, but Hardin's eyes focus on just one. Sef Sermak. He is the youngest, with a neat yellow mustache and intense, serious eyes. Hardin knows this is the man he needs to watch. This is the man with the new ideas. Hardin decides to speak to him directly.
</Person2><Person1>Hardin starts with a compliment, a nice word. He says, "I've been particularly anxious to see you, Councilman, ever since your very excellent speech last month." He's trying to be friendly, to make the meeting easier.
</Person1><Person2>But Sermak is not there to be friendly. His eyes are like hot coals. He says his speech was justified, which means it was right and necessary. He doesn't care that Hardin is older or the mayor. He even says, "You became mayor of the city when you were two years younger than I am now." He is not afraid to challenge Hardin.
</Person2><Person1>Hardin smiles a little. He sees that Sermak is a cool customer, someone who is calm and confident under pressure. So, Hardin gets straight to the point. He asks, "Are you speaking for your three colleagues, or must I listen to each of you separately?"
</Person1><Person2>Sermak's answer is bold. He says, "I speak for the people of Terminus." He believes he represents everyone who is unhappy with Hardin's leadership. And then, he delivers his message. He says they are forming a new political party. Their goal? To throw Hardin and his government out of City Hall.
</Person2><Person1>Wow. That is very direct. But it gets even more intense. Sermak gives Hardin an ultimatum. Mmm... an ultimatum. That is a final demand. If you don't accept it, something bad will happen. Sermak's ultimatum is simple: "Unless you resign now."
</Person1><Person2>He tells Hardin that his promises are worth nothing. The only thing they will accept is for Hardin to leave his job completely. But do you know what Hardin does? He leans back in his chair. He crosses his legs. And very calmly, he says, "I rather think I'll ignore it." He is completely rejecting their demand!
</Person2><Person1>Sermak explains this isn't a warning. It's a fact. The new party is real, and they will fight him in the next election. But Hardin is a smart man. He sees that Sermak sat down a little too quickly when he was asked. He knows Sermak is still waiting for an offer, a deal. So Hardin asks him a question. He asks what, exactly, Sermak wants to change.
</Person1><Person2>And now we get to the real problem. Sermak accuses Hardin of a dangerous policy. For thirty years, Hardin has given scientific help to the Four Kingdoms around them. He gave them nuclear power, medical clinics, and factories. Sermak calls this appeasement. Appeasement... that's when you give an enemy what they want, hoping they will stay peaceful. Sermak thinks this is a terrible mistake.
</Person2><Person1>He says, "You have given them power, given them weapons..." He believes Hardin has made their enemies stronger. He thinks that one day, the kingdoms will use these weapons to attack and take Terminus. He asks Hardin, "Isn't that the way blackmail usually ends?"
</Person1><Person2>So what is Sermak's solution? It's simple and violent. "Stop the bribes immediately... and attack first!" He wants to go to war. He thinks it's the only way to be safe.
</Person2><Person1>Hardin listens patiently. The whole time, he watches Sermak, thinking. He knows that many people on Terminus feel the same way as this angry young man. Then, when Sermak is finished, Hardin asks him to read a framed statement on the wall. The words are: "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent."
</Person1><Person2>What a powerful idea! It means that using violence is the last choice for people who are not clever enough to find a better solution. Sermak just says it's an "old man's doctrine." But Hardin disagrees. He says he used this idea when he was a young man.
</Person2><Person1>Hardin tells a story from thirty years ago, from the first crisis. Back then, the powerful kingdom of Anacreon put a military base on Terminus. They planned to take over the whole planet. Everyone wanted to fight. But Hardin, who was young then, had a different plan.
</Person1><Person2>He didn't attack. Instead, he visited the other three kingdoms. He used words, not weapons. He told them, "If Anacreon gets our nuclear power, it will be very dangerous for you." It was the obvious thing. The three kingdoms understood. Together, they sent Anacreon an ultimatum. And one month later, every Anacreonian soldier was off Terminus. No one had to fight.
</Person2><Person1>Hardin looks at Sermak and asks, "Now tell me, where was the need for violence?" He showed that a clever plan can be stronger than an army. But Sermak is still not convinced. He says that sometimes a problem is like appendicitis. You need a knife. You need an operation. He argues that Hardin's peaceful policies have failed, and now violence is the only option left.
</Person1><Person2>So here we see the heart of their disagreement. Hardin believes in balance and clever strategy. Sermak believes in direct force. It's a clash between two very different ways of thinking. Who do you think is right?
</Person2><Person1>The meeting ends with this tension still in the air. But we are left with a feeling that Hardin has another plan, something Sermak doesn't understand at all. Next time, we will learn more about Hardin’s secret strategy. He has been giving the kingdoms science, but he has presented it as a kind of... magic. And just as this political battle is heating up, an important ambassador is secretly returning to Terminus with urgent news. Things are about to break.
