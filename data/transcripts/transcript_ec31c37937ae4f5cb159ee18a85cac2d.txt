<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Mayor Salvor Hardin told the Board a dangerous secret. His talk of nuclear weapons was a bluff to scare Anacreon. But the Board was furious and decided to trust the distant Galactic Empire for help. Now, the meeting is getting even more intense.
</Person1><Person2>I am so ready for this!
</Person2><Person1>Imagine the room. The air is thick with anger. Hardin stands up. He shouts with all his energy, "If you ask me, the Galactic Empire is dying!" The words hang in the air. Silence. He is so tired from shouting that he drops back into his chair to catch his breath. The other men on the Board are trying to speak all at once, but one man’s voice cuts through the noise.
</Person1><Person2>Who is it? Pirenne?
</Person2><Person1>No, it's a man named Crast. He sounds very annoyed. He says Hardin's words are "hysterical," which means they are wild and full of emotion, not logic. Crast thinks Hardin is not helping. He wants to ignore Hardin's warning and continue the discussion. But then, another man speaks. Mmm… someone who has been quiet this whole time.
</Person1><Person2>Oh, a new player in the game!
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. His name is Jord Fara. He is a very large man, and his voice is deep and slow. He asks a simple question. "Haven't we forgotten something, gentlemen?" He reminds them that in one month, they will celebrate their fiftieth anniversary. And on that day, something special will happen. Hari Seldon's Vault will open.
</Person1><Person2>A vault? What is a vault?
</Person2><Person1>That’s a great question. A vault is a special room with a very strong door. It’s built to keep important things safe, like treasure or… secrets. And this vault holds a message from the man who started everything, Hari Seldon. Pirenne, the head of the Board, doesn't think it's important. He thinks it’s just a simple congratulations message. But Fara disagrees.
</Person1><Person2>I bet Fara is right. It sounds important.
</Person2><Person1>Fara thinks the timing is perfect. He says Hari Seldon was the greatest psychologist of his time. He could understand people and predict the future. Fara believes Seldon knew this crisis was coming. He thinks the vault contains a warning… and maybe even a solution. This idea makes everyone pause. It's a new path, a new hope. Even Hardin, who is a politician now, studied psychology. He becomes very quiet, thinking hard. Things are starting to make a little more sense to him. He feels that psychology is the key.
</Person1><Person2>So, the answer isn't in fighting or in waiting for the Empire. It's in a message from the past?
</Person2><Person1>That's the new idea! And just as they are thinking about this, the person they were waiting for arrives. Lord Dorwin, the Chancellor from the Galactic Empire. And, oh, what a character he is! Picture this: he has long, curly hair that is perfectly styled. He has fluffy blond hair on the sides of his face. And he carries a little box of powder, called snuff, that he sniffs. He speaks in a very fancy, very strange way. He doesn't say his r's. So "Hardin" sounds like "Hahdin."
</Person1><Person2>(soft laugh) He sounds… a little silly.
</Person2><Person1>He does! And Hardin immediately dislikes him. Hardin tries to find Lord Dorwin and Pirenne. He finds them in a dark room, looking at the Encyclopedia on a big screen. Lord Dorwin is telling Pirenne how wonderful the Encyclopedia is. He calls it a "gweat achievement."
</Person1><Person2>But does he talk about Anacreon? The real problem?
</Person2><Person1>Hardin tries to bring it up. He says Anacreon has all the necessities for destruction. But Lord Dorwin just waves his hand. He doesn't want to talk about business. He just came from Anacreon and calls it a "bahbawous planet," meaning it's not civilized. He is much more interested in the Encyclopedia. For the next half hour, they ignore Hardin completely. They just look at old knowledge on a screen.
</Person1><Person2>That must have been so frustrating for Hardin.
</Person2><Person1>Extremely frustrating. When the lights come back on, Lord Dorwin asks Hardin if he is interested in archaeology. Do you know what archaeology is?
</Person1><Person2>I think so. It’s about digging up old things from the ground, right?
</Person2><Person1>Yes, that’s a big part of it! Archaeology is the study of the past by looking at old objects, buildings, and writings. And Lord Dorwin loves it. He is an expert. He’s very excited about a book he saw in the Encyclopedia. It’s about the "Origin Question"—the question of where the human race first came from.
</Person1><Person2>So he’s talking about ancient history while a war is about to start?
</Person2><Person1>Exactly! He talks about different planets where humans might have started, like Sirius or Sol. He is completely lost in the past. He doesn't see the clear and present danger right in front of him. This conversation shows Hardin something very important. The Empire isn't just weak because it's far away. It's weak because its leaders are not living in reality. They are obsessed with the past, while the future is burning.
</Person1><Person2>I see. So the Empire can't help them because the Empire doesn't even understand the problem.
</Person2><Person1>You got it. The great, powerful Empire is just a story now. And Hardin is standing there, seeing the truth very clearly. The Foundation is truly on its own. And that's where we'll leave it for today. The help they hoped for is useless, and a mysterious message from the past is their only strange new hope.
</Person1><Person2>Wow. I can't wait to see what happens next.
</Person2><Person1>Next time, Lord Dorwin’s visit will cause even more trouble. Anacreon will send an ultimatum, a final demand. And Hardin will have to use pure logic to prove to the Board that the Empire’s promises are empty words and that war is coming in just one week. I hope you’ll join us for that! Goodbye for now!</Person1>
