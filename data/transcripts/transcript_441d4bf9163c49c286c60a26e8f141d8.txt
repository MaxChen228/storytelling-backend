<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we saw something very strange. Exactly sixteen percent of the people were sick. Elend knew this was not normal. It was a sign of something powerful… and dangerous. Now, we join Elend in a completely different situation. He is no longer in a quiet room with reports. He is on a battlefield.
</Person1><Person1>But we must remember something important about Elend. He was not born a warrior. He was born a nobleman. His life was one of fancy parties and polite conversation. He was a scholar, a man who loved books and ideas. He never expected to lead an army. A woman named Tindwyl once told him, "I doubt you will ever be the type of leader who can lead a charge against the enemy." Elend smiles now, remembering her words. Because that is exactly what he is doing.
</Person1><Person1>His soldiers crash into the koloss camp. The koloss are big, blue-skinned creatures with red eyes. They are very strong. But Elend has a secret power. He is an Allomancer. This means he can burn metals inside his body to get special abilities. He flares pewter. Pewter is a metal that gives him amazing strength and energy. A warm feeling fills his chest, and his muscles become tight and powerful.
</Person1><Person1>The attack is a surprise. The koloss are confused. Why would a small group of humans attack them? They are slow to react. Elend's army uses this time well. Elend himself strikes first. He cuts down a koloss with his sword. He yells to his men, “Strike quickly! Kill as many as you can before they frenzy!”
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… frenzy. What does that mean? A frenzy is when the koloss become completely wild. They get very, very angry and attack everything in sight. They don't think. They just destroy. Elend needs to defeat as many as possible before that happens. His soldiers are afraid, but they are also brave. Elend helps them. He burns another metal, brass, to Pull on their emotions. He makes them feel braver, and less scared. It's a strange kind of leadership, isn't it? Not with loud shouts, but with quiet, hidden power.
</Person1><Person1>Elend fights a huge koloss, one that is eleven feet tall. Its blue skin is stretched tight because it has grown so big. The koloss swings a massive sword. It's more like a club. Elend is not strong enough to stop it, even with pewter. So he must be quick. He uses his pewter power to be more nimble, to move faster. He dodges the huge sword. He thinks to himself, "How did I get here? I’m a scholar, not a warrior." Sometimes, he feels he thinks too much.
</Person1><Person1>So, he stops thinking and acts. He uses his Allomancy in a clever way. He Pulls on the sword of another koloss. This pulls Elend to the side, just missing the big sword. Then, while he is moving, he strikes. He cuts through the giant koloss's leg. The monster falls, and Elend finishes the fight. His white uniform is now covered in red blood. The other soldiers look at him with awe.
</Person1><Person1>But then, the screams begin. The frenzy is starting. The easy part of the battle is over. The koloss attack with pure rage. Elend's soldiers form a line, but the koloss are too many. The line begins to break. The fighting is grim. Men are dying. Fatren, the leader of the city they are protecting, screams, “We’re doomed! You’ve led us to die!”
</Person1><Person1>The situation looks hopeless. Only fifteen minutes have passed, but it feels like hours. The soldiers are losing. But Elend is not worried. He looks up at the sky. A tiny black dot, a speck, is there. It is getting bigger and bigger. Fatren is covered in blood. He yells, “Why?” He wants to know why Elend brought them here to die. Elend doesn't answer with words. He just points to the sky. “What is it?” Fatren asks. Elend smiles. “The first of those armies I promised you.”
</Person1><Person1>What could it be? An army in the sky? It looks like only one person. How can one person be an army? Next time, we will see who arrives to help Elend and his soldiers in their desperate fight. Thank you for listening to the Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2).
