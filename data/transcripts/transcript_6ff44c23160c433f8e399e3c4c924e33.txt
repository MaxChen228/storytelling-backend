<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). I’m so glad you’re here with me. Last time, Vin learned a huge secret from an old storyteller. She discovered where the city’s hidden treasure, the atium, was located. Now, she stands in the misty night, looking at the building where it’s kept.
</Person1><Person1>Let’s picture the scene together. Imagine a very large, dark building in front of you. It’s called the Canton of Resource. This place was once an important government building, but now… it is a palace. The city’s leader, a man named Yomen, lives and works here. Vin can see many soldiers walking outside. They are guarding the palace carefully. Yomen wants everyone to see this building and remember his power.
</Person1><Person1>Vin looks up at the tall walls. She knows the atium is somewhere inside, probably deep underground. A part of her wants to be brave and reckless, like her old friend Kelsier. She thinks, maybe I should just sneak in right now. But… Mmm… she waits. She knows this is not a good idea. Breaking into a place like this on the first night is too dangerous. This isn't like the last city, Urteau. That building was empty. This one is a fortified palace.
</Person1><Person1>Let's talk about that phrase, a fortified palace. A palace is a home for a king or a very important leader. The word fortified means it is made very strong and safe, to protect it from enemies. It has strong walls, and in this story, many soldiers. So, a fortified palace is like a castle. It’s very, very difficult to get inside.
</Person1><Person1>Vin decides to be patient. She needs to talk with Elend and make a smart plan. So, she turns away from the palace. She uses her magic to push off a coin and flies into the dark, misty sky. She begins to travel across the city rooftops to find another person who can give her information. But as she moves… uh… she gets a strange feeling. She feels that she is not alone.
</Person1><Person1>Someone is following her. She can’t see them clearly in the thick mist, but she can feel them. Vin has a special magic sense. She can burn a metal called bronze to listen for other magic users. So, she does. And she hears it. A very quiet, thumping sound. Thump… thump… thump… The person following her is an Allomancer, a magic user, just like her.
</Person1><Person1>Now, this is interesting. The other Allomancer is trying to hide. They are using a metal called copper, which usually makes them invisible to Vin’s magic sense. But Vin is special. For some reason, she can hear them anyway. It’s a rare ability. She knows the person following her must be a Mistborn, a very powerful Allomancer who can use all the metals, because they are using copper to hide and steel to move at the same time.
</Person1><Person1>Vin isn't surprised. She knew that her loud, magical jumping across the city would get attention. She decides to lead the follower on. Better to know your enemy than to let them hide in the shadows, right? She starts moving faster, going toward the edge of the city, as if she is leaving. The person behind her has to move quickly to keep up.
</Person1><Person1>Soon, she reaches the huge city gates. Her magic sense shows her bright blue lines pointing to the giant iron brackets that hold the gates to the rock wall. Brackets are strong metal pieces used to hold things together. These brackets are perfect. They are big, strong sources of metal. They will make excellent anchors. What is an anchor, you ask? An anchor is a heavy object that holds something in place, like a ship in the water. For Vin, these metal brackets are anchors for her magic.
</Person1><Person1>She uses her power and Pushes hard against the metal brackets. Whoosh! She throws herself backward, flying through the ash and mist at an incredible speed. It’s a sudden, powerful move. She lands softly on a rooftop and immediately looks back. And the other Allomancer… is gone. Not just hiding. The thumping sound from their magic has completely disappeared. Vanished.
</Person1><Person1>Vin is very confused. How did they do that? Why would they suddenly stop using their magic? Did they know she could hear them, even through their copper shield? It doesn’t make sense. And then… Vin feels a chill. A cold feeling of fear. She remembers something else. Something that gives off a magic signal just like that. The mist spirit.
</Person1><Person1>She hasn’t seen the spirit in over a year. It was a strange, mysterious creature. The last time she saw it, it almost killed Elend… but then, it saved him and gave him the powers of a Mistborn. She still doesn’t understand what it is or what it wants. It’s not the evil god, Ruin. She knows that. They feel… different. Was that the spirit following her tonight? It vanished so quickly, so completely. Chilled and full of questions, Vin flies out of the city and hurries back to the safety of Elend’s camp.
</Person1><Person1>Vin is safe for now, but a terrifying new mystery has appeared. Next time, Vin and Elend will talk about the mist spirit, and the dark god Ruin, who can hear everything they say. We will learn that Vin has a secret plan to save the world… a plan so dangerous she cannot even speak it out loud. What could this plan be? And how can she succeed when her enemy is always listening? Join me next time to find out. Goodbye for now.</Person1>
