<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! I am so glad you are here with me today.
</Person1><Person1>Last time, we left Elend making a difficult plan. He sent Vin to scout the city of Urteau. She went alone into the mists, ready to find secrets. Today, our story follows someone else. Someone who is already inside that city.
</Person1><Person1>But first, let's think about the world itself. The Final Empire was built by the Lord Ruler. He was a very powerful man. He lived for a thousand years. And he created a new society, a new culture. How did he do this?
</Person1><Person1>Well, he did something called cultural synthesis. Mmm, that sounds like a big phrase, doesn't it? Let’s break it down. Synthesis is when you take different parts and put them together to make something new. So, cultural synthesis means mixing different cultures. The Lord Ruler took the best parts from many different groups of people. He took their ideas for beautiful buildings. He also took their ideas for fashion… you know, the fancy suits and dresses the nobles wear.
</Person1><Person1>It’s a little funny, actually. He seemed to hate one group of people, the Khlenni. But he copied their style the most. Maybe he was secretly jealous of them. He took what he liked and built his "perfect" empire. It’s interesting to see how a leader can shape the world like that, isn't it?
</Person1><Person1>Now, let's go into the city of Urteau. We find a character named Spook. He is standing in a small, secret room. This room is his lair. A lair is a secret place where someone can hide. It's illegal to have a room like this here. The city's leader wants to watch everyone. But Spook is safe for now.
</Person1><Person1>He is very lucky to be alive. He was in a terrible fire. He remembers jumping from a burning building. But he doesn't remember how he got back to his lair. He was bleeding and hurt. He should be dead. But he’s not. He survived.
</Person1><Person1>Spook stands in front of a small mirror. His shirt is off. He looks at his wound. And he thinks, "I'm alive." Not only is he alive… he feels pretty good. He moves his arm. It hurts, but not as much as it should. Why?
</Person1><Person1>He can feel something burning in his stomach. It’s a metal called pewter. This gives him strength. This is… amazing. You see, in this world, a person usually has only one magic power. Or, they have all of them. It is never just two. But Spook now has two powers. His old power, tin, which makes his senses very sharp. And now, this new power, pewter, which makes him strong and helps him heal.
</Person1><Person1>How is this possible? Spook has an idea. He thinks he saw the spirit of his dead friend, Kelsier. Kelsier is a hero to many people. They call him the Survivor. Spook believes Kelsier appeared and saved his life. But… was it real? Or was it a hallucination? A hallucination is when you see something that is not really there. People sometimes have them when they are very sick or hurt. But if it wasn't real, how did he get the power of pewter?
</Person1><Person1>He looks closer in the mirror. He sees something tiny and shiny in his shoulder. It’s the tip of a sword. The sword that stabbed him. It broke off inside his skin. He reaches to pull it out. But then… he hears a voice.
</Person1><Person1>“No,” the voice says. “Leave it.” It tells him the metal is a sign. A sign that he survived. Spook looks around the room. He is alone. It was Kelsier's voice. He is sure of it. He whispers, "Kelsier?" But there is no answer.
</Person1><Person1>Is he going crazy? Or is Kelsier really watching him? The thought is a little… unsettling. Unsettling means it makes you feel worried or uncomfortable. But, this voice also gave him a wonderful new power. So maybe it’s okay.
</Person1><Person1>Spook decides to focus. He needs information. How long has he been sick? What is the city's leader doing? He puts on his shirt and slips out of his lair into the dark, misty street. He walks through the poor part of the city. It’s called the Harrows. It is very crowded and messy. Shacks and buildings are pushed together. It’s a chaotic place.
</Person1><Person1>But something is different here. In most cities, people hide from the mists at night. But in Urteau, the new leader says the mists are a gift from Kelsier. So, people are not afraid. Spook finds a small tavern. It’s open late at night, which is very unusual. He goes inside.
</Person1><Person1>It's a simple place. Men are sitting around a fire on the ground. Spook finds an empty box to sit on. He closes his eyes and just… listens. With his tin power, he can hear everything. He can hear all the conversations at once. The important skill is learning what to ignore.
</Person1><Person1>A man comes over. He is the bartender. He tells Spook he has to buy a drink. He sells him a bottle of very old, expensive wine. But he sells it for only a few small coins. This shows how much the city’s economy has changed. Things that were once valuable are now almost worthless.
</Person1><Person1>The bottle has a cork in it. Spook looks at it. He thinks, "I wonder…" He is burning a little bit of pewter. It takes away the last of his pain. He decides to use a little more. He stokes the pewter, making it stronger. Then, he grabs the cork and pulls. It pops out easily. He didn't need any tools. Just his new strength.
</Person1><Person1>Spook smiles to himself. He thinks, "I think I’m going to like this." For the first time since the fire, he feels powerful. He feels in control.
</Person1><Person1>So, Spook is alive, with a strange new power, and a voice in his head. He is sitting in a tavern, ready to uncover the city’s secrets. And he will learn so much. He will learn about the leader's strange new rules for the city. He will also discover another amazing benefit of his pewter power. But as he listens, something else will happen. Someone in that tavern will recognize him. They know who he is. And suddenly, Spook will realize he is in very serious danger.
