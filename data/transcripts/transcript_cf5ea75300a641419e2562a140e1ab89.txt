<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left TenSoon in a dark pit, about to be dissolved by acid. But with his last breath, he shouted one word: "Judgment!" And that single word has brought him here, to a great hall, to face all of his people. He is no longer a shapeless body in the dark. He has bones now, a skull, and he can finally breathe again. But he is also on trial.
</Person1><Person2>So, what happens now? Is this trial his chance to be free?
</Person2><Person1>Well, it's not exactly a trial to prove if he is innocent. Everyone believes he is guilty. This is a judgment. It's a time for him to explain his actions before they decide his punishment. Imagine a large, quiet room. The only light comes from lamps. This light makes the red crystal bones of the judge, KanPaar, sparkle. All around, hundreds of kandra are sitting silently. They are not like humans. They don't move or make noise. They just wait, watching TenSoon.
</Person1><Person2>That sounds very intense. What is he accused of?
</Person2><Person1>That's the interesting part. KanPaar leans forward and asks a question, but it’s not the one TenSoon expects. He asks, “Tell them… why you killed one of our own. A fellow kandra.” TenSoon freezes. He thought they would ask about his biggest crime—betraying the great secret of the kandra people. But instead, they start with this.
</Person1><Person2>Wait, he killed another kandra? Is that against their rules?
</Person2><Person1>TenSoon says it isn’t. He stands there, cold and naked on the platform, and says, “That is not forbidden.” He explains that he was following his Contract. A man named Zane commanded him to kill the kandra OreSeur. TenSoon had to obey his master. The kandra Contracts are very specific. They forbid the killing of humans, but say nothing about killing other kandra.
</Person1><Person2>So it’s a loophole? He followed the rule exactly as it was written.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. It's like a game with a very specific rule. The rule says 'don't touch the red squares.' It doesn't say anything about the blue squares. TenSoon is saying he followed the rule. He even reminds KanPaar that they both helped write these rules long ago. Mmm… but KanPaar and the other leaders are not happy. They say killing another kandra sets a disturbing precedent.
</Person1><Person2>A precedent? What does that mean?
</Person2><Person1>A precedent is an action that can be used as an example for the future. They are worried that because TenSoon did this, other humans will now ask their kandra servants to kill each other. It sets a dangerous example that could destroy them all. They accuse TenSoon of being rash, of not thinking about the consequences.
</Person1><Person2>Ah, I see. They’re trying to make him look reckless.
</Person2><Person1>Yes! And TenSoon suddenly understands their plan. They want everyone to think he's just a bad person, so no one will listen to his real story. (soft laugh) But TenSoon is smart. He decides to fight back. He looks at the judges, the Second Generation, and reminds them of their big mistake. He asks, “Who was it who allowed a Contract to be assigned to Kelsier himself?”
</Person1><Person2>Kelsier? The man who killed their god, the Lord Ruler?
</Person2><Person1>The very one. TenSoon points out that they gave a kandra servant to the man who was planning to kill their Father. Suddenly, the judges are the ones who look foolish and rash. KanPaar gets very angry and tells TenSoon to be quiet. He says, “This is not a trial—you have already admitted your guilt. This is a judgment.”
</Person1><Person2>So they shut him down before he can say more. What happens next?
</Person2><Person1>KanPaar moves on to the main accusation. The real reason TenSoon is here. He asks why TenSoon broke his Contract with his master, Zane, and helped Zane's enemy instead. The enemy was the woman Vin.
</Person1><Person2>And this is the big betrayal?
</Person2><Person1>This is the biggest. To understand, we need to know the kandra's great secret. Their weakness. A person with special powers, an Allomancer, can use those powers to take complete control of a kandra’s body. The kandra serve humans in Contracts to keep this secret hidden. They choose to be servants so they don't become slaves. And TenSoon… he told this secret to Vin.
</Person1><Person2>He gave away the one thing that keeps his people safe. Why?
</Person2><Person1>He remembers that day. His master, Zane, was toying with Vin, hurting her. And even though Zane was his master, TenSoon chose to help Vin. He betrayed his Contract, his training, everything… to save her. And in that moment, he told her the secret. Now, standing before the judges, he is ready to explain why.
</Person1><Person2>So he’s finally going to confess everything.
</Person2><Person1>Well, he looks at KanPaar, and at all the silent kandra watching him. And he says something that shocks everyone. He says, calmly and clearly, “I didn’t break my Contract.”
</Person1><Person2>What? But he just admitted that he did! How can that be true?
</Person2><Person1>I know! How can he say that? What does he mean? It seems he has a secret plan after all. We will have to wait until our next chapter to discover what TenSoon is really planning, and what it has to do with a different, more important Contract.
