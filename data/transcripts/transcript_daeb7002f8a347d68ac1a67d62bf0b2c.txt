<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Gaal learning about Hari Seldon's true, secret plan. The trial, the exile to Terminus… it was all part of the design to save knowledge. Now, let's jump forward in time, fifty years into the future, to see how that plan is going.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine a quiet room. In a small corner with good light, a man named Lewis Pirenne is working very hard at his desk. He is the leader of the Encyclopedia Foundation. For fifty years, he and many others have worked on Terminus. Their only goal is to create the greatest encyclopedia the galaxy has ever seen.
</Person1><Person1>Fifty years of work. Fifty years of gathering information. And now, they are so close. In just five more years, the first book will be finished. Everything must be perfect. All the work must be… co-ordinated.
</Person1><Person1>Mmm, that’s a useful word. ‘Co-ordinated’ means making many different people or things work together smoothly, like a team. Pirenne’s job is to make sure every scientist, every piece of research, works together to build the Encyclopedia. It’s a very big, very organized project.
</Person1><Person1>Suddenly, a soft buzzer sounds on his desk. Bzzz. Pirenne is annoyed. He almost forgot he had a meeting. He pushes a button, and the door opens. A man named Salvor Hardin walks in. Hardin is the Mayor of Terminus City, the only city on the planet.
</Person1><Person1>Pirenne does not look up. He keeps writing. Hardin knows Pirenne. He knows Pirenne hates being disturbed. So, Hardin sits down and waits quietly. To pass the time, he takes a small metal coin from his pocket and starts flipping it in the air. Flip… catch. Flip… catch. The light shines on the spinning coin.
</Person1><Person1>“Stop that!” Pirenne says, finally looking up. His voice is sharp. “Stop tossing that coin.”
</Person1><Person1>Hardin puts the coin away. He tells Pirenne he needs to get back to a city meeting. Pirenne sighs. He says, “I hope this is not about city business. The Encyclopedia takes all my time.” He believes his work is the only thing that matters.
</Person1><Person1>But Hardin has important news. He asks, “Have you heard? The leader of the nearby planet, Anacreon, now calls himself a king.”
</Person1><Person1>Pirenne doesn’t care. “So what?” he asks. What does a new king have to do with his Encyclopedia?
</Person1><Person1>Hardin explains the danger. Anacreon is between Terminus and the rest of the Empire. Now, they are cut off. They cannot get shipments of metal, which they need for everything. Their planet has no metal of its own. “How will we get steel? How will we get aluminum?” Hardin asks. He wants Pirenne to call an emergency meeting of the Board, the leaders of the Foundation.
</Person1><Person1>Pirenne refuses. He says, “We are scientists! We do not get involved in local politics.” He believes the great Empire will protect them. Terminus is part of the Emperor’s personal property, he says. No one can touch them.
</Person1><Person1>I can’t help but wonder… is Pirenne being naive? He trusts the Empire completely, but Hardin sees that the Empire is growing weak. He tells Pirenne that twenty other regions are also breaking away. The Empire didn't stop them. Why would it protect Terminus?
</Person1><Person1>Pirenne doesn't listen. He changes the subject. He is angry about the city newspaper. The paper wants to have a big celebration for the Foundation’s fiftieth anniversary. Pirenne thinks this is silly. He also mentions a special Vault that is scheduled to open soon. But he says this event is only for the Board, not for the public.
</Person1><Person1>Hardin disagrees. He says the city has freedom of the press; he cannot control the newspaper. This makes Pirenne even angrier. He reminds Hardin that he, Pirenne, is the Emperor’s representative. He has the real power on Terminus.
</Person1><Person1>Hardin takes a deep breath. He has one last piece of news. He says it very calmly. “Anacreon is sending a special envoy to us. He will arrive in two weeks.”
</Person1><Person1>Ah, another interesting word. An ‘envoy’ is an official messenger sent by a government. This person is coming to speak for the new King of Anacreon.
</Person1><Person1>Pirenne is confused. “An envoy? Here? Why?” he asks. Hardin stands up to leave. He looks at Pirenne and says, “I give you one guess.” And then he walks out of the room.
</Person1><Person1>So, let’s review. We have a big problem. Terminus is isolated. A powerful new king is their neighbor. The leader of the Foundation, Pirenne, thinks they are safe because of the Empire. The city’s mayor, Hardin, knows they are in danger.
</Person1><Person1>Two weeks later, the envoy arrives. His name is Anselm haut Rodric, a nobleman from Anacreon. Mayor Hardin meets him at the spaceport. There is a big ceremony with cheering crowds. The envoy is very formal. He and Hardin exchange their guns as a sign of peace. But Hardin notices the envoy still has another, smaller gun hidden under his shoulder.
</Person1><Person1>As they drive through the city, the envoy looks around. He asks strange questions. “You have a lot of empty land. Have you thought about dividing it into large farms, or estates?” he asks. Then he asks, “You have no peasants? No poor farm workers?”
</Person1><Person1>Hardin understands. The envoy is trying to learn about Terminus. He is trying to find its weaknesses. Hardin answers carefully. He says, “No. We have no peasants… and no nobility.” He says it with a small smile, making a quiet point that on Terminus, everyone is equal.
</Person1><Person1>The envoy doesn't seem to understand the irony. He is a nobleman, and he sees the world through the eyes of power, land, and class. It’s a very different way of thinking from the scientists of the Foundation.
</Person1><Person1>So, the stage is set. We have a conflict between two worlds. The world of science and knowledge, led by a blind Pirenne. And the world of politics and power, represented by this new king and his envoy. Hardin is caught in the middle, trying to protect his city. What does this envoy from Anacreon really want? It seems he is interested in more than just trade.
</Person1><Person1>Next time, we will find out. The envoy will reveal Anacreon’s true plan for Terminus, and it is not friendly. He will demand they establish a military base on the planet and start paying taxes. Pirenne’s faith in the Empire will be tested, and the Foundation will face its first great crisis.
