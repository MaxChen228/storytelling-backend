Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings.
When we last left our story, the fate of the Foundation hung on a single moment. Aboard the flagship of Anacreon's war fleet, High Priest Theo Aporat had just seized control of the ship's communications, ready to confront the crew and their sacrilegious mission. Back on Anacreon, Mayor Hardin waited calmly, his entire plan hinging on what would happen next, light-years away.
Let's step onto the bridge of that ship. Picture the scene. The air is thick with tension. Aporat’s voice suddenly takes on a deeper, more resonant tone. An acolyte beside him listens with pure veneration, which means deep respect, while the two soldiers guarding him are filled with a growing, mounting fear. Aporat declares that because the ship is on a "devil's errand," the blessing of the Galactic Spirit has been removed from it.
Mmm… can you feel the shift in the air? He then lifts his arms solemnly, and his image appears on a thousand televisor screens all over the ship. Soldiers, wherever they are, cower at this stately, powerful image of their priest. And then, he speaks the words that will change everything.
He says, "In the name of the Galactic Spirit and of his prophet, Hari Seldon… I curse this ship."
He speaks of the ship as if it’s a living being. He commands its eyes, the televisors, to become blind. Its arms, the grapples, to be paralyzed. Its fists, the nuclear blasts, to lose their function. He continues, cursing its heart, its voice, its breath, and finally, its very soul—the lights. "Let its lights… shrivel into nothing," he commands.
And as he speaks that final word, precisely at midnight, a switch is flipped light-years away. An ultrawave relay is opened, and instantaneously, the signal reaches the flagship.
And the ship… died. (soft laugh) It’s just so dramatic. Because, as the book tells us, the chief characteristic of this religion of science is that it works. Aporat's curse isn't just words; it's a command sent to the very systems Hardin's engineers had installed. It’s deadly.
Aporat stands in the sudden, total darkness. The soft purring of the hyperatomic motors just… stops. He feels a moment of pure triumph, of exultation, and pulls out his own small light, a nucleo-bulb, filling the room with a pearly glow. He looks down at the two soldiers. These are brave men, warriors, but now they are on their knees, writhing in what the text calls "the last extremity of mortal terror." They are whimpering, begging him to save their souls.
And Aporat, now completely in command, sternly tells them, "Follow."
The ship becomes a maze of darkness, and the fear is so thick you could almost smell it. The text describes it as "palpable," which means it's so intense you can practically touch it. Soldiers crowd around Aporat and his little circle of light, desperate just to touch the hem of his robe. And to every plea, his answer is the same: "Follow me!"
Soon, he finds the ship's commander, Prince Lefkin, son of the regent Wienis. Lefkin is stumbling through the dark, cursing, furious. He sees Aporat and his eyes are filled with hate. He demands to know the meaning of this treason. "I am commander here," he insists.
"No longer," Aporat replies, his voice heavy and somber.
Lefkin completely loses control. He screams at his men to arrest Aporat. He shrieks, trying to break the spell. "Are you allowing yourselves to be fooled by this mountebank, this harlequin?" Mmm, what a word… a "mountebank." It means a charlatan, a fake, someone who deceives people. Lefkin sees Aporat as nothing more than a trickster using "clouds and moonbeams."
But Aporat interrupts his furious rant. "Seize the blasphemer," he commands the soldiers. "You listen to him at the peril of your souls." And just like that, the prince, the admiral, is pulled down by the hands of his own men. The old power is broken.
Aporat has them drag the beaten prince back to the communications room, to the one televisor that still works. He orders Lefkin to command the rest of the fleet to turn back to Anacreon. Disheveled and stunned, Lefkin obeys. Then, Aporat makes him speak directly to his father, Wienis, dictating every single word.
Now, imagine we are back in the room with Hardin and Wienis. The televisor screen flickers to life, showing the haggard face and shredded uniform of Prince Lefkin. Wienis just gasps and collapses into a chair. Hardin remains perfectly still, watching.
And we hear Lefkin’s tired, reluctant voice, pausing as if being prompted… and not gently. He announces that the navy refuses to be part of this "abominable sacrilege." He issues an ultimatum: the war against the Foundation must stop, and the regent Wienis must be imprisoned and tried by a religious court. Otherwise, the navy will return and blast the palace to the ground.
The screen goes blank. The room is silent.
Hardin dims his own light, and in the shadows, a soft aura can be seen around him. Not the blazing light of a king, but something quieter, more effective. His voice is softly ironic as he speaks to the broken man who, just an hour ago, had threatened him.
He tells Wienis an old fable. It's about a horse who was terrified of a wolf. Desperate, the horse asks a man for help. The man agrees, but only if the horse allows him to put on a bridle and saddle. The horse agrees. The man gets on, hunts down the wolf, and kills it. The horse, overjoyed, says, "Thank you! Now, please take off the bridle and saddle and set me free." But the man just laughs and says, "Never!"
Hardin lets the silence hang in the air. "You see the analogy, I hope," he says quietly. The kings of the Four Kingdoms were the horse. Their fear of their own people was the wolf. And the Foundation… the Foundation was the man they asked for help. By accepting the religion of science to make themselves divine, they handed the Foundation the bridle and saddle—control of all nuclear power.
Wienis finally snaps. He leaps to his feet, his eyes maddened, and screams incoherently. He thunders at his soldiers, "Shoot me down that devil. Blast him!"
Hardin simply turns in his chair to face the soldiers, and he smiles. One soldier raises his weapon… and then lowers it. The others don't even move. Wienis's power is utterly gone.
And it is in this moment of complete defeat that Wienis makes one final, desperate move. Consumed by rage, he tries to kill Hardin himself. But what happens when that kind of raw, uncontrolled fury meets a calm, calculated plan protected by a force-field? And what happens after the dust settles? We are pulled back to Terminus, where the Time Vault is preparing to open for only the second time. Hari Seldon is about to appear again. What new crisis has been overcome, and what new warning will he bring for the future?
Join me next time as we find out. Until then, happy reading.
