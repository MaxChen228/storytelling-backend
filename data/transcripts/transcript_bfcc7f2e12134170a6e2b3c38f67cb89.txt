<Person1> Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left Elend standing before the strong walls of Fadrex City. He believes a secret storage place, a cache, is hidden inside, and that it holds the only hope for his people. But his ally, Cett, thinks it's a foolish plan. Now, Elend must decide the next move for his entire army. Let’s see what he does.
</Person1><Person1>Inside a command tent, the air is thick with tension. Elend speaks first, his voice calm and clear. “The cache remains our primary target,” he says. This means the secret storage place is their most important goal. I can just picture Vin, standing beside him, a small smile on her face. She trusts his decision completely.
</Person1><Person1>Cett, however, lets out a long sigh. He knows what this means. “This siege could take a while,” he says. A siege… that is when an army surrounds a city and waits. They stop food and water from going in, hoping the city will give up. It is a slow, difficult kind of war.
</Person1><Person1>Elend nods. He is ready. He begins to give orders, like a true emperor. He tells his friend Ham to send engineers, the clever builders of the army, into the mists. Their job is to find a way for soldiers to cross the deep ditches around the city. He also wants spies to sneak inside and ruin the city's food. This will make the siege shorter.
</Person1><Person1>Cett listens, and then he offers a different idea. A much faster, and much darker, idea. “Of course,” he says, “there’s one easy way to sow chaos in that city…” To sow chaos means to create a lot of confusion and trouble. Cett wants to kill King Yomen.
</Person1><Person1>Elend immediately says no. Ham agrees, his face growing dark with anger. But Cett argues. He reminds them that Vin has fought and killed before. But Elend stops the argument. “The reason we’re not going to assassinate Yomen,” he says, “is because I want to try diplomacy first.”
</Person1><Person1>Diplomacy? Cett can hardly believe it. Diplomacy is when leaders from different places talk to each other to solve problems without fighting. “Didn’t we just march an army of forty thousand soldiers on his city?” Cett asks. “That’s not a diplomatic move.” He has a point, doesn't he?
</Person1><Person1>But Elend explains. They have not attacked yet. He is here now, in person. He wants to try talking before he tries fighting. Maybe, just maybe, he can persuade King Yomen that an alliance, a friendly agreement to work together, is better than a war.
</Person1><Person1>This is where we see how much Elend has truly changed. Cett complains. If there is an alliance, he won't get his old city back. Elend looks at him, his voice firm. “You seem to be forgetting yourself, Cett,” he says. He reminds Cett that he knelt before him, that he promised to serve him. Elend is the emperor. He makes the decisions.
</Person1><Person1>For a moment, there is silence. Cett just sits in his chair, looking at Elend. Then, a slow smile spreads across his face. “Damn, boy,” he says. “You’ve changed a lot.” Mmm… even his enemy can see it. Elend is no longer just a young scholar. He is a king.
</Person1><Person1>With the decision made, Elend gives everyone their jobs. Vin will scout the city. She will go in secretly to find information. Cett will give her a list of people inside who might help. Ham will make sure their army camp is safe and strong. The plan is to gather information before they do anything else.
</Person1><Person1>Later, after the meeting, Elend and Vin stand alone outside in the strange mists. They look up at the fires burning on the city walls. Vin is quiet for a moment. She is still thinking about Cett’s idea. “You didn’t deny that you might turn to assassination,” she says softly.
</Person1><Person1>Elend looks at her. “Hopefully it won’t come to that,” he answers. He will only do it if it is the best thing for the empire. It is a heavy weight for him to carry. You can feel the love between them in the quiet moments. He offers to go with her, to help her scout.
</Person1><Person1>She smiles and kisses him. “Sorry,” she says gently. “But you’re noisy.” (soft laugh) He tries to argue, but she just teases him more. “Plus, you smell,” she says. “Like an emperor.” She means he has the scent of power, something a special kind of spy could easily notice. She knows how to hide herself, how to become invisible. But he cannot.
</Person1><Person1>She is dear, and she is blunt. She tells him the truth, always. He gives her the list of names from Cett. “Have fun,” he says. She kisses him one last time, and then she is gone, shooting up into the dark, misty sky. A ghost on a secret mission.
</Person1><Person1>So, Elend has shown his strength as a leader, choosing a path of careful planning and hope over quick violence. Vin is now his eyes and ears inside a dangerous city. But their story is not the only one. Far away, in the city of Urteau, another friend is in trouble. Spook wakes up, and he should be dead. He was in a burning building… but somehow, he is alive. Not only is he alive, but his wounds are healing with impossible speed. He feels a new power burning inside him, a power he has never had before. And then… he hears a voice. A familiar voice, from a hero they all thought was gone forever. What has happened to Spook? And whose voice is he hearing in his mind? We will have to find out next time.</Person1>
