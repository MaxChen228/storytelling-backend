<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we left our Master Trader, Hober Mallow, in a very tense meeting with Commdor Asper of Korell. Mallow had just passed a dangerous test involving a missionary, and he suspected that Asper’s humble, ‘man of the people’ personality was just an act. Now, we join them mid-conversation, right in the thick of the negotiation, and Asper is laying out his complaints.
</Person1><Person2>He starts with this… this almost crying tone, a plaintive whine. He says the Foundation has always been unreasonable, pushing its religion along with its trade. He brings up a world called Askone, which he claims was taken over, not by force, but by missionaries setting up temples and schools until the world lost its independence. He paints this picture of the Foundation as a religious empire, hiding behind commerce.
</Person2><Person1>And you can just feel the trap being set, can't you? He's trying to get Mallow to defend the Foundation's religion, to fall into the same old argument. But Mallow… Mallow is brilliant. He doesn't defend it. He doesn't argue. He simply steps around the trap entirely. He just says, "None of what you speak is at all what I suggest."
</Person1><Person2>It's such a powerful move. He then tells Asper, "I'm a Master Trader. Money is my religion." Imagine the Commdor's surprise! Mallow says all the mysticism and hocus-pocus of the missionaries just annoys him. He completely disarms Asper by agreeing with him, making them seem like they're on the same side. The Commdor even laughs and puts a friendly hand on his shoulder.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly! But Asper is still suspicious. He says, "You have told me what the catch is not. Now tell me what it is." And Mallow’s answer is just perfect. He says the only catch is that the Commdor is going to be burdened with an immense quantity of riches.
</Person1><Person2>Mmm, and Asper tries to play the humble leader again, saying the love of his people is his true wealth. But Mallow sees right through it. He knows greed is the real language here. So, he decides it's time for a demonstration. A little show-and-tell. They go inside Asper's home—which Mallow notes looks more like a fortress than a palace, a perfect home for a so-called "Well-Beloved" leader who needs thick walls and guards.
</Person2><Person1>Yes, that detail tells you everything you need to know about Asper. Inside, they bring in a young woman, and Mallow pulls out a simple, flat metal chain. He snaps it around the girl's waist. At first, nothing happens. The Commdor is unimpressed. But then, Mallow tells the girl to move a small knob.
</Person1><Person2>And this is where the magic happens. The text describes it so beautifully. It says she was drowned in a pale, streaming luminescence… as if someone had torn the aurora borealis out of the sky and molded it into a cloak. Can you just picture that? Liquid fire, shifting colors, wrapping around her. Then Mallow hands her a necklace of dull pebbles, and as soon as they touch the light, they burst into crimson and gold flames.
</Person2><Person1>The girl is just fascinated, staring at herself in the mirror with adoration in her eyes. The demonstration is a complete success. Mallow gives the belt to the Commdor as a gift for his wife, the Commdora. And importantly, he makes a point of saying, "it will work for you without… mark you, without… priestly help."
</Person1><Person2>Right. He's hitting that point again and again. No religion necessary. At first, the Commdor dismisses it. He calls it "feminine frippery." That’s our vocabulary spotlight for today. Frippery means showy, decorative things that aren't really useful or valuable. He sees a pretty light show, but he doesn't see the power in it yet.
</Person2><Person1>But Mallow quickly shows him. He asks if they have balls and receptions. He explains that women would pay a fortune—ten thousand credits!—for jewelry like that. And then he reveals the masterstroke: the power unit only lasts for six months. They will always need replacements.
</Person1><Person2>Mmm, planned obsolescence. A classic business tactic. Mallow offers to sell them for a thousand credits' worth of iron, giving the Commdor a nine hundred percent profit. You can practically see the gears turning in Asper’s head. He immediately starts scheming about keeping the supply small to let people bid for them, and how to hide his own involvement.
</Person2><Person1>And Mallow is ready for that, too. He offers to explain how dummy corporations work. He’s not just selling a product; he's selling a whole system of corruption and wealth. From there, he expands his pitch. Collapsible stoves, knives that never need sharpening, automatic laundries… an entire line of household gadgets that will make life easier for the public and make the government incredibly rich.
</Person1><Person2>And then he goes for the final hook. He says, "I could retool your factories." He offers to upgrade their steel foundries with technology that would slash production costs to one percent. He's offering Asper personal wealth, popular support, and now, industrial power. It's an irresistible package.
</Person2><Person1>It really is. The Commdor is completely sold. He agrees to a demonstration at a foundry the next day and invites Mallow and all his men to dinner. But even as he agrees, he gives one last warning: "none of your religion." And Mallow’s reply is so dry, so perfect. He says, "Commdor, I give you my word that religion would cut my profits."
</Person1><Person2>It’s the ultimate reassurance for a man like Asper. The chapter ends with a short, chilling scene. We meet the Commdora, Licia. She is cold, her voice is tart, and she clearly despises her husband. She mocks him, and you can just feel the bitter tension between them. It’s a hint that not all is well in the fortress-palace.
</Person2><Person1>That little glimpse of the Commdora adds such a fascinating layer of instability to the situation. So, Mallow has masterfully navigated the negotiation, turning a conversation about religion into a pure business deal built on greed. He has an invitation to dinner and, more importantly, access to Korell's industrial heart. But what will he find at that steel foundry? The easy access feels… a little too easy. As we’ll find out next time, the demonstration reveals something shocking—a symbol of a galactic power long thought to be dead, which will force Mallow to make a dangerous choice and begin a secret mission of his own. Join me then.</Person1>
