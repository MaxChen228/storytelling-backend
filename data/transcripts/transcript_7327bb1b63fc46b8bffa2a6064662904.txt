<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, Mayor Hardin argued with the Board of Trustees. He said they were wrong to just wait for help. But the Board decided to trust Hari Seldon's plan. They are all waiting for Seldon's Vault to open. Let's see what happens.
</Person1><Person2>Hardin tries one last time to make them understand. His voice is almost pleading. He says, “You men, and half of Terminus, you are just as bad.” He explains that everyone thinks the Encyclopedia is the most important thing. They think science is just about studying the past. But Hardin asks, isn't there new work to do?
</Person2><Person1>He gives them a scary example. He says, “We’re receding and forgetting, don’t you see?” Out in the Periphery, planets have lost nuclear power. A power plant even had a meltdown because no one knew how to fix it. The great Empire isn't training new technicians. No. Instead, they just use less nuclear power. They are moving backward.
</Person1><Person2>“Don’t you see?” he asks for the third time. “It’s a worship of the past. It’s a deterioration - a stagnation!” Mmm… let’s look at that word, stagnation. Stagnation is when something stops growing or moving forward. Think of a pond with no fresh water. The water just sits there. It becomes still and unhealthy. Hardin is saying the entire Galaxy is like that still pond. It’s not learning or changing. It's in a state of stagnation.
</Person2><Person1>The Board members just stare at him. Jord Fara finally speaks. He says Hardin's ideas won't help them. He asks, “Do you deny that Hari Seldon planned for all of this?”
</Person1><Person2>“No, of course not,” Hardin replies quickly. But he says they can’t just wait for Seldon to give them the answer. They must find the solution themselves. He tells them they don’t even understand the real problem. They think it’s just about Anacreon. Hardin believes the problem is much, much bigger.
</Person2><Person1>Then he asks them a very important question. Why were there no expert psychologists on the Foundation from the beginning? Why? He gives his own answer. “Perhaps because a psychologist might have caught on to what this was all about.” He thinks Seldon wanted them to be a little lost. He wanted them to find the truth slowly. With a harsh laugh, Hardin says, "Good day, gentlemen!" and walks out of the room.
</Person1><Person2>But Hardin isn't just talking. He has a secret plan. The story moves to Hardin's office. He is tired. He is chewing on a cigar that isn't even lit. He’s talking with his trusted friend, Yohan Lee. They are planning something very dangerous. They are planning a coup d'etat.
</Person2><Person1>A coup d'etat. That sounds complicated, right? It's a French phrase. It means taking control of the government suddenly and forcefully. Hardin plans to take power from the Board of Trustees. He tells Lee they must act with impudence. In other words, they must be bold and confident. They have to give orders as if they were born to do it. Then, people will obey out of habit.
</Person1><Person2>Lee is worried. He asks why the Board hasn't stopped them. Hardin explains that the Board members can’t imagine a revolt. They believe so strongly in authority—in the Emperor and in themselves—that they can’t see what is happening right in front of them. Their blindness is Hardin's best weapon.
</Person2><Person1>But when Hardin is alone, we see he is not as confident as he seems. He feels like he is just guessing. He is trying to understand the plan of Hari Seldon, the greatest mind of the age. What if he is wrong? What if the Board is right? It’s a huge risk.
</Person1><Person2>Now, the time has come. We are in the Vault. The room is quiet and tense. The five Board members sit together, whispering. Hardin sits alone, as far away from them as possible. Everyone is watching a large, empty glass cubicle in the center of the room.
</Person2><Person1>Then, it happens. The lights in the room suddenly go dim. And when Hardin looks back at the glass cubicle… it is no longer empty. A figure is sitting inside. A man in a wheelchair.
</Person1><Person2>The man smiles. His voice is old and soft. He says, “I am Hari Seldon.” He explains that he is just a recording, made fifty years ago. He can’t see or hear them. He tells them to relax. Then he drops a bombshell. He says, “The Encyclopedia Foundation… is a fraud, and always has been!”
</Person2><Person1>Can you imagine the shock in that room? A fraud. Seldon explains the Encyclopedia was just a trick. It was a way to bring 100,000 people to Terminus and keep them busy. Now, that trick is over. Their real work must begin.
</Person1><Person2>Wow. Everything they worked for was a lie. A necessary lie, maybe, but still a lie. So, if the Encyclopedia isn't the real plan, what is? And what does Seldon mean when he says their real project must now begin? We will find out what Hari Seldon says next in our next episode. Goodbye for now.</Person2>
