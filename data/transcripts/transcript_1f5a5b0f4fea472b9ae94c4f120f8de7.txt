<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Spook and Durn in the city of Urteau. They watched as the city's new leader, the Citizen, prepared to execute ten people he called noblemen. Let's see what happens now.
</Person1><Person1>“They tried to hide,” the Citizen says to the crowd. “But they think they are better than us. And that is why we do what we must.” He waves his hand, and his soldiers push the prisoners toward a large, beautiful house. Spook, with his special hearing, can smell oil in the air. The soldiers force the people inside the house and lock the door from the outside. Then… each soldier lights a torch. They throw the torches at the building.
</Person1><Person1>The house starts to burn. Instantly. A great fire, hot and bright. The crowd moves back. They are scared, but they cannot look away. The windows were covered with wood, but Spook can see fingers… fingers trying to pull the wood away. He can hear people screaming inside. He hears them hitting the locked door, trying to escape. Oh, it’s a terrible, terrible sound.
</Person1><Person1>Spook wants to do something. He wants to help them. But he knows he cannot fight all those soldiers alone. He was sent here to get information, not to fight. He feels like a coward as he turns away from the fire. “This should not be,” he whispers.
</Person1><Person1>But Durn, the man with him, says, “They were noblemen.” Spook is angry. “No they weren’t!” he says. “They were normal people, like us.” Durn disagrees. He says, “This is what the Survivor, Kelsier, taught us. Death to the noblemen. Rule by the skaa.”
</Person1><Person1>Hearing this makes Spook feel sick. He remembers Kelsier. Kelsier’s words gave people hope. But now, the Citizen uses those same words to create hate and death. It’s like taking a beautiful song and making it ugly. Spook looks at Durn and says, “Tell me why I am here, or I will not pay you.”
</Person1><Person1>The large beggar looks at him. “Count the skulls,” he says quietly. And then, he disappears into the crowd. “Count the skulls.” Mmm, what could that mean? Spook doesn’t follow. The smell of smoke and… burning is too strong for him. He needs fresh air. He pushes through the people and leans against another building, breathing deeply.
</Person1><Person1>He hears the Citizen’s voice again. The leader is talking to the crowd, telling them to be vigilant, which means to be careful and watch for danger. After the fire, the crowd starts to leave. The Citizen walks back to the market, and the people follow him. Spook thinks, First he punishes them, now he needs to bless them. It’s a strange kind of leadership, isn’t it?
</Person1><Person1>Spook takes a different path. He goes down a side street and into a dry canal. He moves easily, like someone who grew up on the streets. He gets to the Marketpit before the Citizen does. He hides and watches as the Citizen arrives with hundreds of followers. Ash is falling from the sky, like a gray snow.
</Person1><Person1>Spook listens to the Citizen talk to the market people. “The ash that falls is a sign from the Survivor!” the Citizen shouts. “It represents the fall of the empire! From these ashes, we will build a new nation!” Spook feels a deep anger. He thinks, This man is no Kelsier. He is stealing Kelsier’s legacy.
</Person1><Person1>Now, Spook starts to move. He pretends to be a blind man, feeling his way with his hands. It’s a clever disguise. People don't pay attention to a blind beggar. And when people ignore you… you can go where you are not supposed to go. Spook remembers always being ignored when he was younger. He wanted to be a hero like Kelsier, but he was just a quiet boy nobody noticed. Now, he uses that skill. It's his special power.
</Person1><Person1>He slowly, carefully, makes his way to the front of the crowd. A soldier pushes him, but it’s a helpful push. It puts Spook right where he wants to be. He is now standing just an arm’s length from the Citizen. And right next to him is the Citizen’s sister, Beldre. She is always there, watching, but never speaking. She is quiet and easy to forget, just like Spook used to be. He understands her.
</Person1><Person1>As he stands there, he notices something. A small detail. Beldre smells faintly of perfume. But… perfume is not allowed in this new city. It’s forbidden. A small rule, but she is breaking it. Mmm… interesting.
</Person1><Person1>Spook has seen the Citizen’s cruelty. He has heard him twist good words into words of hate. And now, standing beside the silent sister with her secret perfume, Spook knows he must do something. Next time, Spook will finally act. He is going to confront Beldre and tell her a shocking secret: he plans to kill her brother. But the Citizen is hiding a secret of his own, a power that Spook does not expect. We'll find out what it is in our next story. Goodbye for now!</Person1>
