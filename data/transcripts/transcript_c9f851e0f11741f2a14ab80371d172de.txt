Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings.
Last time, we left Spook in a dark tavern. He was alive, which was a surprise. He had new, strange powers he didn't understand. He felt strong, but also very confused. He went to this tavern in a hidden part of the city called the Harrows. He was there to find information.
Now, let's go back to that tavern. Picture it. Spook takes a drink of wine, right from the bottle. He isn't there for a party. He is there to listen. The room is filled with the sound of quiet conversations. The sounds are muffled, which means they are quiet and not very clear, like hearing people talk through a closed door.
Most of the conversations sound harsh, and angry. These are not happy people. They do not like the city's new leader, a man named Quellion. Spook hears one man whisper, "He's going to get rid of coins." Another man says this sounds just like the old Lord Ruler. Mmm... that's interesting. Spook knows that Vin killed the Lord Ruler, not Kelsier, but these people are far from the capital city. News travels slowly.
Spook keeps listening. He is searching for special conversations. He is looking for… furtive whispers. That's a wonderful phrase. 'Furtive' means secret, and quiet. It's when you do something because you don't want other people to see or hear you. Like a child secretly taking a cookie. Spook is looking for those secret talks.
And he finds one. In a dark corner, two men are talking. They whisper that the leader, Quellion, is checking everyone's family history. He is looking for anyone with noble blood. Anyone whose great-great-grandparents were noble. This leader wants to create a new government. Only people with pure, non-noble blood can be in it. The men think they can make money by helping people hide their family history.
Spook takes another drink of wine. And he notices something very strange. He doesn't feel drunk. (soft laugh) He smiles a little. It must be his new pewter power. It makes his body stronger. Strong against pain, and also strong against alcohol. This could be a very useful skill.
He then hears another group of men talking. They are talking about working in the mines. And this... this makes Spook feel a sudden chill. He remembers his own past. He thinks, 'That could have been my life.' He thinks about his uncle, Clubs. Clubs saved him from a life in the mines. Spook still doesn't understand why. Why did his uncle travel so far, and spend so much money, to save a nephew he never met?
He feels small. He compares himself to the others in Kelsier's crew. Kelsier, Vin, Sazed, Breeze… they were all great. They did important things. But Spook feels he was just… there. He feels like a flake of ash, just a tiny piece of something, pushed around by the wind. He always did what other people told him to do. And he remembers his biggest mistake. He ran away when his uncle Clubs was dying.
He looks up, and a sad feeling comes over him. He whispers to himself, so quietly, "I just want to be able to help."
And then… a voice answers. A voice that only Spook can hear. "You can," the voice says. "You can be great. Like I was." It's Kelsier's voice.
In that moment, everything changes for Spook. He decides he will not feel small anymore. He will not be a flake of ash. Kelsier himself gave him this new power. He can use it. He can help the people of this city. He thinks, 'I ran away once. I don't ever have to do that again!'
He feels all his senses become stronger. He can feel the wood of the stool he's sitting on. He can feel the floor vibrate when people walk. And he feels the pewter burning inside him, like a warm fire. He makes the power stronger.
The bottle in his hand cracks! His fingers are suddenly too strong. He drops the bottle, but with his other hand, he catches it before it hits the floor. His arm moves so fast it's just a blur. He blinks. He is amazed at his own speed. Then, he smiles. He is going to need more pewter.
But then… the conversations in the room stop. The room becomes quiet. And the silence is… eerie. That's our second word, 'eerie'. It describes a feeling that is strange and a little frightening. Like the sound of the wind in an empty house at night. The quiet in this tavern is an eerie quiet.
Spook looks to the side. The men who were talking about the mines are looking right at him. One of them whispers, "That's him. I'm telling you, I saw him get run through by the guards. Everyone thought he was dead."
Oh no. This is not good. Spook thought nobody would remember him. But they do. They know who he is. They know he was on Kelsier's crew. His secret is out. He is not just another person in a tavern. He is known. And he is in danger.
So, Spook stands up slowly, trying to act normal. And then, he flees into the night.
Spook now has a new purpose, a new reason to be strong. But his mission just became much more difficult, and much more dangerous.
And while Spook runs into the dark streets of Urteau, another hero is moving silently in a different city. Vin.
Next time, we will follow Vin as she moves through the city of Fadrex at night. She is also on a secret mission to gather information. But she is worried. Worried about her past, and worried about the future of the entire empire. What secrets will she find in the darkness?
