<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Spook in a very difficult situation. He watched the Citizen’s soldiers do a terrible thing, and he felt powerless. Now, he is in a large crowd, disguised as a blind man, and he is getting close to the Citizen’s sister, Beldre. He knows he must do something. He has to act.
</Person1><Person1> Spook asks himself a question. What would Kelsier have done? Kelsier was his hero, you know. He was brave. He always acted. Spook feels his heart beating very fast. It sounds so loud to him now with his special hearing. The crowd starts to move, and it pushes him right next to Beldre. This is his chance. The guards are not watching them. They are only watching her brother, the Citizen. So, Spook leans close and whispers in her ear. He says, “Your brother… you approve of his murders?”
</Person1><Person1> Mmm… can you imagine her surprise? She turns around quickly. And Spook sees for the first time that her eyes are green. He lets the crowd push him away from her. She looks around, confused. She is trying to find the person who spoke. But the crowd carries her away, following her brother. Spook waits for just a moment. He is being <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɒsəld">jostled by all the people around him.
</Person1><Person1> That word, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈdʒɒsəld">jostled, is a great one for this scene. It means being pushed and bumped by many people in a crowd. It’s like when you are on a very busy train, and everyone is moving around you. Spook is being jostled in a sea of people.
</Person1><Person1> But he is very skilled. He carefully moves through the people again until he is beside Beldre once more. He whispers another question. “You think this is any different from what the Lord Ruler did?” She turns again, and this time, she sees him. She finds him in the moving crowd. He stands still, looking at her, even with his blindfold on. People move between them, and she is carried away again. But he sees her mouth move. With his enhanced senses, he can read her lips. She is asking, “Who are you?”
</Person1><Person1> He has to get to her one more time. The crowd is getting bigger. Her brother, the Citizen, is going to make a big speech. People are gathering around a <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈpoʊdiəm">podium in the middle of the market. A <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈpoʊdiəm">podium is a small, raised platform. It's a place for a person to stand when they give a speech, so everyone can see and hear them. It is getting very difficult for Spook to move.
</Person1><Person1> He reaches her, but the crowd pulls him away. So, he does something bold. He reaches out and grabs her hand. He pulls her wrist so they can stay together. Of course, she turns around, surprised. But she does not scream. She just looks at him with his blindfolded eyes. Again, she mouths the words, “Who are you?” Her brother begins to speak from the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈpoʊdiəm">podium. Spook leans in and says softly, “I’m the man who will kill your brother.”
</Person1><Person1> He expected her to scream. (soft laugh) I mean, that would be a normal reaction, right? But she doesn't. She is very calm. Ash from the sky falls between them. She mouths another sentence. “Others have said that same thing.” Spook holds her hand tightly. He replies, “Others were not me.” For a third time, she asks, “And who are you?”
</Person1><Person1> This is the moment. He tells her the truth. “The companion of a god. A man who can see whispers and feel screams.” He tells her he knew Kelsier, the Survivor. He says that Kelsier would be horrified by what her brother is doing. He gives her a warning. “Tell Quellion that I’m coming for him.”
</Person1><Person1> And then… everything changes. The Citizen stops speaking. Spook looks up at the stage, the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈpoʊdiəm">podium. Quellion is standing there, looking over the crowd. He is looking right at Spook and Beldre. They are at the back of the crowd, and now they are completely exposed. Quellion shouts, “You there! What are you doing with my sister!”
</Person1><Person1> Oh no. Spook lets go of her hand and runs. But the streets are like a trap, with high, steep walls. All the exits are watched by soldiers. At the Citizen’s command, the soldiers run toward him. Spook knows he has to fight. He pulls out his special weapon, a dueling cane. And the fight begins.
</Person1><Person1> Now, Spook is not a true warrior like some of his friends. But he has a secret advantage. His senses are incredibly sharp. He can feel the air move when a sword swings. He can feel a footstep on the ground. He knows where people are just by the sound of their hearts. It is almost like magic. It’s almost like having atium.
</Person1><Person1> He ducks a sword. He steps away from another attack. He spins and hits a soldier in the head. He breaks another soldier’s arm. He is so fast! He blocks a third sword, but his wooden cane breaks. So he quickly grabs a sword from a fallen soldier. Only one soldier is left. If he can beat this last man, he can escape.
</Person1><Person1> But the soldier is smart. He waits, trying to waste time. So Spook attacks. He raises his sword to strike. And then… something impossible happens. His sword freezes in the air. It just stops. He tries to push it forward, but he can’t. It feels like he is pushing against a solid wall.
</Person1><Person1> It’s Allomancy. Someone is using magic to Push against his sword. Spook looks around desperately. An Allomancer can only Push directly away from themselves. So the person must be right in front of him. And there, standing with his sister, is Quellion. The Citizen. He is the one Pushing the sword. The leader of this city is an Allomancer. Spook is trapped, facing an enemy with a power he did not expect.
</Person1><Person1> Spook is in terrible danger. He cannot fight when his enemy can stop his sword with magic. But the situation is even worse than he knows. There are other hidden enemies in the crowd, with their own secret powers. Next time, Spook will be stabbed by a sword. But will he die? And what secret power might Spook have that could save him from a fatal wound? Join us next time to find out.</Person1>
