<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Gaal Dornick and Hari Seldon in a very difficult place. They were arrested, and their big trial was just about to begin. Seldon was surprisingly calm, but now he must face the most powerful people in the government.
</Person1><Person1>Let's step into the courtroom together. (pause) Can you picture it? It is a very grand and serious room. High up, behind a long desk, sit five judges. They are the Commission of Public Safety. They wear beautiful uniforms of scarlet and gold, which are bright red and yellow colors. On their heads, they have shiny plastic caps. This shows everyone that they are judges. In the very center sits the most important one, the Chief Commissioner, Linge Chen. Gaal has never seen anyone so powerful. He just watches Chen, fascinated. But Chen... he is completely silent. He doesn't say a single word. His silence shows that he believes talking is for less important people.
</Person1><Person1>The trial is already happening. Hari Seldon is standing and answering questions. A lawyer, called the Advocate, is asking them. He looks at his notes and begins. He asks Seldon, "How many people work on your project?" Seldon answers simply, "Fifty mathematicians." The Advocate then asks about Gaal Dornick. Seldon explains that Gaal will be the fifty-first member. The Advocate tries to make Seldon look confused. He asks if maybe there are fifty-two, or even more. But Seldon is very clear. Right now, there are fifty. When Gaal joins, there will be fifty-one.
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… but the Advocate has a secret number. He says, "Aren't there almost one hundred thousand people?" Seldon agrees, but he clarifies. He says, "I believe you are counting women and children." The Advocate gets a little angry. He raises his voice and says the exact number is ninety-eight thousand, five hundred and seventy-two people. He tells Seldon not to argue about small things. And Seldon just calmly says, "I accept the figures." He is not fighting. He is just stating facts.
</Person1><Person1>So, the first point is clear. Seldon's project is huge. It's not just fifty scientists; it's a community of almost one hundred thousand people. The government knows this, and they think it is very suspicious.
</Person1><Person1>(pause)
</Person1><Person1>Now, let's talk about a word the Advocate used. He told Seldon not to "quibble." To quibble means to argue about very small details that are not really important. Imagine you are talking about a big problem, like fixing a house. Quibbling would be like arguing about the color of one small nail. The Advocate is saying, "Let's not argue about whether we call them 'members' or 'individuals'. Let's talk about the real issue."
</Person1><Person1>The Advocate moves to the next topic. It is the most dangerous one. He asks Seldon to repeat his ideas about the future of Trantor. Seldon does not hesitate. He says, "Trantor will lie in ruins within the next three centuries." The words hang in the air. It's a shocking thing to say. The Advocate asks if Seldon thinks this is disloyal. Seldon's answer is amazing. He says, "Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty." He means that facts are just facts. They are not good or bad, loyal or disloyal. They just... are.
</Person1><Person1>The Advocate smiles. He tries to make Seldon's science sound like magic, something only Seldon can understand. He says that truth should be simple and clear for everyone. Seldon disagrees. He gives an example. He says that thermodynamics, which is the science of energy, is true. But not everyone can build a power engine. Even very smart people cannot do it. He is about to say that maybe the Commissioners don't understand it, but he is interrupted. One of the judges whispers angrily to the Advocate. The Advocate's face turns red. He quickly tells Seldon, "We are not here to listen to speeches."
</Person1><Person1>Now the Advocate accuses Seldon directly. He suggests that Seldon is predicting disaster because he wants to create disaster. He suggests Seldon hopes to make people lose trust in the government. And maybe, he wants to use his hundred thousand people as an army. Seldon denies everything. He explains that only ten thousand of his people are old enough to be soldiers, and none of them know how to fight. He is not working for anyone. He is only serving science.
</Person1><Person1>This brings us to a really interesting idea. The Advocate asks, "Can the future be changed?" Seldon says yes, but it is very, very difficult. And here, he explains a key part of his science. He talks about inertia. Mmm... inertia is a word from science. It means that something very large and heavy is hard to stop once it starts moving. Think about a giant spaceship flying through space. You can't just make it stop or turn instantly. It has inertia. Seldon says a whole planet of people, an entire Empire, has a huge inertia. It is moving in a certain direction, toward ruin. To change it, you would need something just as big and powerful. A hundred thousand people are not enough. Not even in three hundred years.
</Person1><Person1>The Advocate sees his chance. (soft laugh) He thinks he has caught Seldon in a trap. He speaks slowly now, feeling very clever. He says, "Okay, Dr. Seldon. So... your one hundred thousand people cannot stop the destruction of Trantor. And you say they are not for any illegal purpose. In that case..." and he pauses for effect, "...what is the purpose of your hundred thousand?"
</Person1><Person1>The room is suddenly loud. Everyone is talking. They all see the trap. What can Seldon possibly say? If his project can't save the Empire and isn't a secret army, then what is it for? Only Linge Chen, the Chief Commissioner, remains still and silent. Seldon waits calmly for the noise to stop. Then, he gives his answer. "To minimize the effects of that destruction."
</Person1><Person1>He explains that the fall of Trantor is just one part of a much bigger story: the decline and fall of the entire Galactic Empire. At this, the room explodes. People are shouting "Treason!" The Advocate tries to speak but no one can hear him. The Chief Commissioner, Linge Chen, slowly lifts a small hammer, a gavel, and hits the desk once. The sound is like a deep bell. And the room becomes silent again.
</Person1><Person1>The Advocate asks Seldon if he understands he is talking about an Empire that has lasted for twelve thousand years. Seldon says he understands its history better than anyone in the room. He says the fall is not his opinion; it is mathematics. He doesn't want it to happen. The time of anarchy, or the time with no government, after the fall will be much worse than the Empire. His project is there to fight that anarchy. But the fall is too big to stop. It's happening because of many small changes over centuries.
</Person1><Person1>And then, Seldon uses a powerful metaphor. He says the Empire looks strong now, but it is like a rotten tree. A rotten tree can look tall and mighty right up until a strong wind breaks it in two. He says, "The storm-blast whistles through the branches of the Empire even now. Listen with the ears of psychohistory, and you will hear the creaking."
</Person1><Person1>So, Seldon's secret is revealed. He is not trying to stop the impossible. He is preparing for what comes after. He wants to save human knowledge to make the dark age shorter. But he has just admitted, in front of the Empire's most powerful judges, that the Empire is dying. What will they do to him now? The silent Linge Chen has heard everything. The real decision will come from him. Next time, Seldon and Gaal will have a private meeting with Chen. Seldon will be given a choice: execution... or exile to a lonely planet at the far edge of the galaxy. His great plan is just beginning.</Person1>
