<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we left Elend and his army with a new feeling of hope. He gave a powerful speech, and they are preparing to march. But today… we are going somewhere very different. Somewhere much darker.
</Person1><Person1>I want you to picture a man. He is sitting on a tree stump, completely still. He has not moved in hours. He looks like a statue. Grey ash falls from the sky, covering his shoulders and his head. He is in a camp with a huge army of creatures called the koloss. They are loud, and sometimes… they fight and kill each other. It is not a peaceful place.
</Person1><Person1>This man’s name is Marsh. And he is not free. A powerful, evil thing called Ruin controls him. Ruin makes Marsh do things he does not want to do. But recently, Ruin has been busy somewhere else. So, Marsh has more time alone with his thoughts. And his thoughts are… difficult.
</Person1><Person1>He feels a constant fight inside his mind. Part of him wants to be controlled by Ruin. When Ruin is in control, the dying world seems beautiful. It is a happy feeling, but it is not real. Marsh knows this. The other part of him, the real Marsh, feels a deep sadness, a dread, as he sits there being buried in ash. He knows he must fight this feeling. He must not give up.
</Person1><Person1>He thinks, “What am I missing?” He looks at the huge koloss army. Three hundred thousand of them. They haven't moved in weeks. They are just… sitting here. It seems like a waste. Why isn't Ruin using them? Why not attack the city of Luthadel? And why is Marsh, the most powerful Inquisitor, left here to do nothing?
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… it’s a good question, isn't it? This brings us to a useful word from our story: stagnate. The army has started to stagnate. To stagnate means to stop moving or making progress. Think of water in a small pond that doesn't move. It just sits there. That is stagnant water. The koloss army is the same. It is not moving forward. It is just staying in one place, and the creatures are becoming restless.
</Person1><Person1>As Marsh sits there, he feels guilty. He remembers a time, long ago, when he was a leader. Thousands of people looked to him. But then… he gave up. He left the rebellion. He thought it was impossible to win. He was always a practical man, you see. But then his brother, Kelsier, did the impossible. Kelsier returned and he overthrew the entire empire.
</Person1><Person1>Marsh thinks, “That should have been me.” He feels he is doing it again. He is giving up, just like before. He feels so much frustration. He even feels angry at his dead brother, Kelsier, because Kelsier never gave up. Kelsier fought for the woman they both loved, Mare. He fought for her dream of a world with flowers and a blue sky. Kelsier failed to bring that world back… but he died trying. He died for that dream.
</Person1><Person1>And this thought… this thought changes something in Marsh. He is not dead yet. He can still fight. But how? If he even moves a finger, Ruin will notice. The story uses another important word here: struggle. To struggle is to fight very hard against something difficult. Marsh has been struggling against Ruin in his mind. But now, he decides on a new plan. He will stop the struggle they can see.
</Person1><Person1>He realizes something amazing. Ruin can watch anything in the world. No walls can block its view. But… it cannot see inside a man’s mind. It cannot read his thoughts. This is his chance. This is his secret weapon.
</Person1><Person1>So, he makes a decision. He will pretend. He will let Ruin think it has won. He will not struggle at all. He will wait for the perfect moment. And when that moment comes, he will do the one thing Ruin does not expect. He will remove the metal spike from his own back. This will kill him, but he knows he is an important tool for Ruin. By killing himself, he can disrupt Ruin's plan. He can give everyone else a chance to win.
</Person1><Person1>It is all he can give. But it is enough. He feels a new confidence. His brother, Kelsier, killed himself to give people freedom. Now, Marsh will do the same. He will do it to help save the entire world.
</Person1><Person1>So, we end this part of our story with Marsh. He is sitting in the ash, a statue on the outside, but a hero on the inside. He has found his own way to fight. Next time, we will return to Vin and Elend. They are finally on the move, but they face a new and terrifying problem. The mists, which have always protected Vin, are changing. They are becoming an enemy. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
