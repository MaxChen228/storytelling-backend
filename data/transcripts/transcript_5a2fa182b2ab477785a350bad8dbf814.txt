<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we left Hober Mallow in a moment of pure tension. Right after revealing his political ambitions to Ankor Jael, his chief rival, Jorane Sutt, walked through the door. The confrontation was immediate, with Sutt demanding to know what Mallow had really been doing on the planet Korell. The air must have been absolutely electric.
</Person1><Person1>And this chapter throws us right into that fire. Sutt doesn't waste a single second on pleasantries. He immediately lays out his case, listing all the signs of Mallow's newfound and, in his eyes, suspicious wealth. He talks about the factories Mallow is building in a hurry, the money it's all costing, and… Mmm… this is my favorite part… he gestures around at Mallow’s home with, the text says, a “cold lack of appreciation,” calling it a palace. He accuses Mallow of cutting an “expensive swathe” through high society. You can just feel the icy judgment in his voice, can’t you? He's not just asking questions; he's painting a picture of a corrupt upstart.
</Person1><Person1>But Mallow… his response is just masterful. He doesn't get defensive. He doesn't deny it. Instead, he leans into the accusation with this incredible confidence. When Sutt asks where the money is from, Mallow smiles and says, “That's why I'm going to tell you. It's straight from the treasure-chests of the Commdor of Korell.” (soft laugh) Can you imagine the look on Sutt’s face? Mallow completely disarms him by admitting a truth that sounds like an outrageous lie. He explains it was a legitimate trade deal—trinkets for iron and chromite—and that half the profit is his by contract. He frames Sutt’s spying as irrelevant, as pointless as knowing what he had for breakfast.
</Person1><Person1>And this is where the conversation deepens, moving from money to a fundamental clash of ideologies. Sutt shifts his attack, saying it's the “general custom” for traders to spread the Foundation’s religion along with their goods. But Mallow’s reply is so sharp, so precise. He says, “I adhere to law, and not to custom.” This is the core of their conflict. Sutt represents the old way: using religion as, in his words, the “most potent device known with which to control men and worlds.” He believes trade exists only to serve this spiritual empire.
</Person1><Person1>Mallow sees that policy as completely outdated and dangerous. He argues that no one in the Periphery wants their religion anymore. The stories of how the Foundation used it to take over other worlds have spread. For him, the path forward isn't forced belief, but mutual benefit. He says, “a sincere friendship through trade will be many times better than an insecure overlordship.” It's a battle between hard power disguised as faith, and soft power driven by economics. Which do you think is more sustainable in the long run?
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… and let's pause on a phrase Ankor Jael uses later to describe Sutt's mindset. He calls Sutt's obsession with religious domination his “idée fixe.” That’s a French term, an idée fixe, which means a fixed idea, an obsession that a person just cannot let go of. It perfectly captures Sutt's rigid, unyielding worldview. He is so locked into this one way of thinking that he can't even comprehend Mallow's perspective. For Sutt, anyone who doesn't follow the plan must be bought or broken.
</Person1><Person1>And that's exactly what he tries to do. When Sutt realizes he can't win the argument, he tries to bribe Mallow, first with a bigger share of profits, then with a council seat. Mallow just laughs at him, saying, “I'll have that anyway, without and despite you.” The confidence is just astounding. So, Sutt's tone turns venomous. His final offer is a threat: a twenty-year prison term. And when Mallow still doesn't flinch, Sutt reveals his trump card: a trial for the murder of a Foundation priest. The tension just snaps. Suddenly, this isn't a political debate anymore. It’s a matter of life and death.
</Person1><Person1>After Sutt leaves, savoring what he believes is his victory, Ankor Jael’s analysis is absolutely chilling. Jael suggests that Sutt, this supposed defender of the faith, doesn't actually believe in the religion at all. He thinks Sutt is using it for his own, as he says, “unspiritual aims.” Jael warns that a dogma based on faith is a dangerous weapon, because it can always be turned back on the user. The Foundation's religion has become so traditional, so immovable, that it's no longer fully under the government's control. It has a life of its own.
</Person1><Person1>So we're left with this terrifying possibility. Sutt isn't just trying to remove a political rival. He may be planning to use the very religion the Foundation created as a weapon against it, to mobilize believers and seize power for himself. And Mallow is walking right into his trap—a public trial where he's already been painted as a heretic and a murderer. But what Sutt doesn't know is that the trial might be the exact stage Mallow has been waiting for. Next time, we'll see Mallow stand before a hostile crowd, ready to be condemned. But he begins his defense with a shocking revelation about a spy Sutt planted on his ship… a spy that Mallow knew about all along. Our Master Trader, it seems, is always one step ahead. Join me next time as we see his plan unfold.</Person1>
