<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we were deep underground. We found a huge, secret cavern with a lake. It felt like a safe place, a good place to hide. But today… today we are not in a safe place. We are preparing for a very dangerous party.
</Person1><Person1>But first, let's think about a big question. For a long time, people thought the Lord Ruler hated the Terris people and their religion. But we know a secret now, don't we? The Lord Ruler, Rashek, was a Terrisman himself. So why did he try to destroy his own people's religion? Mmm… I think it was about the prophecies. The stories about the Hero of Ages.
</Person1><Person1>Rashek knew about a special place, the Well of Ascension. He knew its power would return one day. If the Terris religion was still strong, maybe someone would find the Well. They could take the power and use it to defeat him. So, he hid the truth. He made the stories confusing. He wanted to keep the power all for himself. It was a plan born from fear.
</Person1><Person1>Now… let’s leave those dark thoughts and go to a boat. Can you picture it? The sun is setting. The sky is orange and purple. The mists are starting to come in, covering the water like a soft, white blanket. The boat rocks gently. On this boat are Elend, Ham, and Cett.
</Person1><Person1>Elend is going to a ball tonight. A party in Fadrex City, the city of his enemy. He asks his friends, “You’re not going to try and talk me out of this?” He sounds a little amused, you know? He already knows it's a crazy idea.
</Person1><Person1>And Elend lists all the reasons why it’s a bad plan. He says, first, he could be captured. Second, everyone will see that he is a Mistborn. Third, he and Vin, the only two Mistborn they have, will be in the same place. That’s very risky. And finally… going to a party during a war is just… well, it’s crazy!
</Person1><Person1>But Ham, his good friend, just shrugs. He says Yomen, the leader of Fadrex, would be crazy to attack Elend. If Elend is in the room, then Yomen is also in danger. Cett thinks Yomen will just run away when they arrive. But Elend disagrees. He thinks Yomen will stay. He thinks Yomen wants to pretend everything is normal, just like in the Lord Ruler's time. So, if Elend and Vin come to his party, Yomen will play along.
</Person1><Person1>They even talk about what happens if something goes wrong. Elend talks about the imperial succession. That word, succession, is about who becomes leader next. It’s the plan. If Elend dies, Vin will be in charge. If they both die, Sazed will be the next emperor. It’s a serious conversation. It shows us how dangerous this night really is.
</Person1><Person1>While they talk, Elend is worried about Vin. She is in their cabin, getting ready. She is wearing a dress that belonged to one of the cooking girls. Elend worries it will look too simple for a fancy ball. He is preparing a kind smile for her, to make her feel better. The cabin door opens. He turns… and he just freezes.
</Person1><Person1>Vin is standing there. And she is… stunning. She is wearing a beautiful black gown with silver lines. Her dark hair is down, and it curls a little around her shoulders. She wears no jewelry, only her small earring. The one from her mother. Elend always thinks she is beautiful. But this… this is different. He tries to speak, but no words come out.
</Person1><Person1>She walks over and kisses him. “I’ll take that as an indication that I managed to put this thing on right,” she says with a little laugh. Ham starts chuckling. He looks at Vin and says it feels like just last week she was a small, scared girl hiding in corners. Now, look at her.
</Person1><Person1>And Vin smiles. She remembers being that girl. She says, “It has been five years, Ham. I’m twenty-one now.” Five years. It’s a long time. So much has changed. She has grown up. She is not just Vin anymore. She is an Empress. She is the Hero of Ages.
</Person1><Person1>Elend finally finds his voice. He makes a joke. He says, “If that dress is what the cooking girls are wearing, I’m paying them far too much.” (soft laugh) He asks where she got such a beautiful dress. Vin just smiles and says, “It’s a mystery. We Mistborn are incredibly mysterious.”
</Person1><Person1>And with that, it’s time to go. The sun is gone. The mists are thick. Vin jumps from the boat. She Pushes on the metals in the ground and flies up into the night air. Elend follows her, Pushing himself into the mist. They are flying toward the enemy’s castle. Toward the party.
</Person1><Person1>So, Elend and Vin are on their way. Dressed for a ball, but ready for a fight. They are a king and queen going into the heart of their enemy’s city. What will happen when they arrive? What will the people in the grand ballroom do when the Emperor and Empress suddenly appear? Next time, the party begins… and everything will change. Join me then.</Person1>
