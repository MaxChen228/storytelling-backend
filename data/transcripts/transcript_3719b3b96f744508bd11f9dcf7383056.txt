<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). I'm so glad you're here. Last time, we left TenSoon in a difficult place. He was judged by his own people for helping Vin. Now, we leave that dark, underground place. We travel to join Vin and Elend. And we find that they are also facing their own quiet worries.
</Person1><Person1>The chapter opens with a secret about the past. A secret about the Lord Ruler, Rashek. It tells us he was very clever. He knew the power in the Well of Ascension would return one day. So, he moved it. Think about that. He changed the whole world to hide it. He made new mountains. He flattened his own homeland and built his city there. He protected the Well right in the center of his palace. It was a very smart plan to keep his power safe.
</Person1><Person1>But now, let's join Vin and Elend in their room. Picture the scene. Vin is sitting on their bed. She is worried. She tells Elend, “I’m worried about him.”
</Person1><Person1>Elend is looking in a mirror. He is getting dressed. He asks who she means. Sazed? Vin nods. She is worried about their friend, Sazed. Elend sees her in the mirror. She is wearing simple clothes. But he is wearing a special white uniform. It is bright and clean, even in this world of ash. His uniform has gold buttons. It is made to look 'regal', which means it makes him look like a king. It’s a symbol of hope for his soldiers. In a world of black ash, their leader wears white.
</Person1><Person1>Elend tries to comfort Vin. He says Sazed is strong. He has lost people before. But Vin knows this time is different. She says, “It’s more than just one death to him.” She believes Sazed lost his faith when Tindwyl died. Faith is a very important word here. Faith. It means to trust or believe in something you cannot see. Vin says Sazed always had faith. He believed something good was watching over the world. Now, that belief is gone.
</Person1><Person1>Elend doesn’t fully understand. He says they all have lost people. He lost his father. He lost his best friend. But Vin sees more. She sees the sadness spreading. It's not just Sazed. She is also worried about their friend, Breeze.
</Person1><Person1>She says Breeze “tries too hard.” He pushes on everyone’s emotions to make them happy. He laughs too loudly. Vin says he is 'overcompensating'. Overcompensating. That is when you do too much of something to hide how you really feel. Breeze is trying to make everyone feel happy because he is actually very scared. Mmm… it's like he's putting on a brave face. Have you ever done that? Laughed when you really wanted to cry?
</Person1><Person1>Vin tells Elend, “They’re my friends, Elend. I know them.” She can feel it. Her friends are giving up. They are starting to believe they cannot win. One by one, their hope is fading. It’s a quiet, terrible problem. It’s not an army they can fight. It’s a feeling inside their hearts.
</Person1><Person1>Elend listens. He finishes getting dressed. He looks at himself in the mirror. He sees the uniform, the scars, the beard of a warrior. But he looks deeper. He looks into his own eyes. He searches for the king he is supposed to be. And he isn't sure he sees one. He doesn't feel like a perfect king. But he knows he has to be strong for everyone.
</Person1><Person1>He turns from the mirror. He tells Vin she is right. He promises to fix it. That is his job now. As the emperor, he has one single duty: to make everything better. What a heavy weight to carry. He must not only fight armies, but he must also fight the sadness in his friends’ hearts.
</Person1><Person1>So, Elend accepts his duty. He must restore hope. But as we will see next time, a new problem is coming. A problem much bigger than sadness. They will look at a map, and this map will show them a terrifying future. They will learn that the mists are not their only enemy. There is something else. Something that was trapped, and is now free. Something with a name: Ruin.
</Person1><Person1>Thank you for listening. Join us next time for more of the Storytelling Series. Goodbye for now.</Person1>
