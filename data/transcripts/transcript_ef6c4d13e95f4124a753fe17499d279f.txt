<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we saw Hari Seldon make a very difficult choice. He accepted exile to a distant planet to save his life's work. Now, he and his young friend Gaal are leaving the powerful Linge Chen, and a new chapter begins.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine this for a moment. You are in a small taxi, deep under the ground of a city that covers an entire planet. There are no windows. Just long, dark tunnels, like the tunnels a worm makes in the earth. The taxi makes a soft, high sound as it moves. Whine… whine… whine. For a long time, there is only silence. This is where Gaal and Seldon are now. They are traveling for hundreds of miles through these tunnels, back to the University.
</Person1><Person1>After a long silence, Gaal finally speaks. He looks at the old man, Hari Seldon. He asks, "Was it true?" He needs to know. "If Chen killed you, would the great Fall happen faster?" Seldon looks at Gaal with calm eyes. "I never lie about my science," he says. "And Chen knew I was telling the truth. He is a very smart man. He understands people."
</Person1><Person1>Gaal is still confused. "Then… why did you accept exile?" he asks. Why leave Trantor if you had the power? But Seldon… he doesn't answer. He just sits quietly. (pause) And then, their taxi bursts out of the tunnels. Suddenly, there is light! So much light. Gaal had almost forgotten a sun could exist. The University buildings are not the hard, gray steel of the city. No, they are silvery. A beautiful, soft color, almost like ivory.
</Person1><Person1>So, in this part, Gaal is asking big questions. He is trying to understand Seldon's plan. But Seldon is quiet. It feels like we are seeing the world through Gaal's eyes. Everything is new and a little scary for him.
</Person1><Person1>As they look at the beautiful university, Seldon says something strange. "Soldiers, it seems." Gaal looks down from the bright sky to the ground. And he sees them. A soldier, a sentinel, is standing there. Waiting. A captain comes out from a doorway. He is polite, but his voice is firm. He asks, "Dr. Seldon?"
</Person1><Person1>"Yes," Seldon says. The captain gives them the news. "You and your men will be under martial law." Mmm… let's talk about that phrase. Martial law. That is when the army is in control of a place, not the normal government. The soldiers make the rules. So, Seldon and his people are now like prisoners of the army. The captain continues, "You have six months to prepare to leave for Terminus."
</Person1><Person1>Six months! Gaal is shocked. "Six months?" he starts to say. How can they prepare thousands of families for a trip to the edge of the galaxy in only six months? It feels impossible. It feels like a slow death sentence. But Seldon gently puts his fingers on Gaal's arm. A signal to be quiet. The captain just repeats, "These are my instructions," and then he is gone.
</Person1><Person1>This is a big moment of conflict. They are free, but not really. They are under martial law, and they have a deadline that seems impossible. You can feel Gaal's panic, can't you? But Seldon… Seldon is still so calm. It makes you wonder, what does he know that Gaal doesn't?
</Person1><Person1>They finally reach Seldon's office. Seldon tells Gaal to be quiet until they are inside. Why? Because this office is special. It is spy-proof. This means no one can listen to what they say inside. It's very clever. If someone tries to listen, they don't hear silence. They hear a random, normal conversation made by a machine. It sounds real, but it's not. It's the perfect hiding place for secrets.
</Person1><Person1>Inside, Seldon is finally relaxed. "Now," he says, "six months will be enough." Gaal cannot believe it. "I don't see how," he says. And here, Seldon shares a very important secret about his plan. He tells Gaal that in a good plan, you use the actions of other people. You know what they will do before they do it. He says they studied Linge Chen very, very carefully. They knew how he thought. They knew how he would act. The trial, the questions, the danger… it was all planned to get the result they wanted.
</Person1><Person1>"You planned… to be exiled to Terminus?" Gaal asks, his voice full of surprise. "Why not?" Seldon replies with a little smile. He touches a secret spot on his desk. A part of the wall slides open. Inside, there are small microfilms. Seldon tells Gaal to take the one with the letter 'T' on it. 'T' for Terminus, of course.
</Person1><Person1>Seldon puts the film into a projector and gives Gaal special eyepieces to watch. As Gaal watches, his eyes get wider and wider. He sees it all. Plans. Lists. Preparations for moving to Terminus. He looks at Seldon. "You have been preparing to leave for two years?" he asks. Seldon corrects him. "Two and a half years," he says. They hoped Chen would choose Terminus, and they made all their plans based on that hope.
</Person1><Person1>This is the big discovery! The exile was not a defeat. It was the plan all along! Seldon was not reacting to Chen; he was guiding him. It's like a chess game, and Seldon is thinking many, many moves ahead. It changes everything we thought we knew.
</Person1><Person1>But Gaal still has one more question. A very important one. "But why? Why did you arrange the exile? Why leave Trantor?" Seldon explains a little. On Terminus, they can work with support from the Empire, but they will be so far away that the Empire will not worry about them. They will be safe and forgotten. He also adds another reason. Maybe twenty thousand families would not want to move to the end of the galaxy on their own. The exile forces them to go.
</Person1><Person1>And then, Seldon shares the biggest secret of all. He tells Gaal that there will be a scientific refuge on Terminus. And another one. A second one, at the other end of the galaxy. At a place he calls "Star's End." Two foundations, not one. (pause) This is amazing, isn't it? The plan is bigger and more complex than anyone knew.
</Person1><Person1>Seldon then tells Gaal something very personal and sad. He says his doctors tell him he will die in a year or two. He is not sad about it. He says he has done what he wanted to do in his life. He is ready. After he dies, others will continue the work. "Perhaps even yourself," he tells Gaal. The plan will continue. And then, in a very soft whisper, the old man says, "I am finished."
</Person1><Person1>So, the takeaway from this chapter is huge. Seldon is the ultimate planner. His 'defeat' was actually his greatest victory. He controlled the situation to get exactly what he needed: a forced exile to a specific planet where his project could grow in secret. And we learn there are two Foundations, creating a mystery about the second one at "Star's End." Seldon's work is done, and now it is time for the next generation to carry it forward.
</Person1><Person1>And that is where our story will go next. We will travel to Terminus, many years later. A new generation has grown up there. The people are no longer just scientists from Trantor; they are the people of Terminus. But the galaxy around them is changing. The Empire is getting weaker. A powerful neighbor, Anacreon, is becoming a threat. The new mayor of Terminus, a man named Salvor Hardin, sees the danger. But will the scientists who lead the planet listen to him? Or are they too focused on their books to see the real world? The quiet world of science is about to meet the loud world of politics. Join me next time to see what happens.</Person1>
