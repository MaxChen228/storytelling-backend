<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide A2. I'm so glad you are here with me today.
</Person1><Person1>Last time, we arrived in the dark city of Urteau. Remember? Sazed, Breeze, and Allrianne met a soldier. And that soldier was their old friend, Spook. But Spook was different. He wore a cloth over his eyes. And he was taking them somewhere secret. Let's see where they go now.
</Person1><Person1>They stop in front of a very large building. Sazed gets out of the carriage and looks up. He feels a little worried. He asks Spook, "Is this the Ministry Canton of Inquisition?"
</Person1><Person1>The Inquisition was the Lord Ruler's secret police. They were very, very scary. Spook is standing on the steps. He turns and nods his head. He says the city's leader, Quellion, did not burn these buildings. Spook thinks Quellion is afraid of the Inquisitors.
</Person1><Person1>Breeze, who is still in the carriage, says that being afraid of Inquisitors is a good idea. It is a rational fear. That means it is a smart and normal fear to have. But Spook just makes a small sound. He says the Inquisitors are busy. They are trying to find Vin. Then he says, "Come on," and walks up the steps.
</Person1><Person1>Sazed follows him. Breeze sighs loudly and asks a soldier to bring him a parasol. A parasol is like a special umbrella to protect him from the falling ash. It's funny, isn't it? Even in a dangerous place, Breeze still wants to be comfortable.
</Person1><Person1>So, let's picture this scene. A huge, dark building made of wood. Ash is falling from the sky like slow, gray snow. And Spook is leading them to this place. A place that everyone else is afraid of.
</Person1><Person1>This building is very imposing. That's our first word for today. Imposing. It means something is so big and important that it makes you feel small. Think of a huge castle or a very tall mountain. That is imposing. This building was a symbol of the Lord Ruler's power.
</Person1><Person1>Inside these buildings, there were priests. But they were not like Sazed. Most were office workers, or bureaucrats. They worked with paper and numbers. This control of information was the real power of the Final Empire.
</Person1><Person1>Let's recap. Spook has taken them to an old, imposing Ministry building. He is not afraid, but Sazed and Breeze are a little nervous. Now, what will they do?
</Person1><Person1>Spook stands by the big doors. The doors are closed with wooden boards. He looks up at the sky, waiting. Sazed thinks about Spook. He has been very quiet since his uncle, Kelsier, died.
</Person1><Person1>Then, Spook begins to pull the boards off the door. He tells Sazed, "I'm glad you're here." Sazed goes to help him. He pulls on a board, but it doesn't move. It is stuck. Mmm... but when Spook pulls on boards, they come off very easily. That's strange, isn't it?
</Person1><Person1>Sazed asks Spook why he is happy to see him. Spook laughs a little. He says he is not a lord. He says he only wanted to be a lord to impress women. Then, Spook reaches over. With just one hand, he easily pulls off the board that Sazed could not move.
</Person1><Person1>Sazed is shocked. What? Sazed is not strong like a soldier, but he did not think Spook was so strong. He must have been training. Spook then says he has important things to talk about with Sazed. Things about gods and men.
</Person1><Person1>He pushes the door open. Inside, it is a big, dark room. Spook walks into the darkness and disappears. Sazed waits. He calls out, "Spook? I can't see." After a moment, Spook says, "Oh. Right." A small light from a lantern starts to glow inside.
</Person1><Person1>Breeze comes and stands next to Sazed. He speaks quietly. He asks if Spook seems different. Sazed agrees. He says Spook seems more confident now. More sure of himself. But he wonders about the blindfold. Why does he wear it?
</Person1><Person1>Breeze just shrugs. He says Spook was always a little strange. He thinks maybe the blindfold is a disguise. So people don't know he was part of Kelsier's team. Breeze and Allrianne go inside the building.
</Person1><Person1>Sazed stays outside for a moment. He tells the captain of the soldiers to make a perimeter. That means the soldiers will stand guard outside and keep them safe. Finally, Sazed takes a breath and goes inside too.
</Person1><Person1>So, Spook is much stronger. He is more confident. But he is also more mysterious. He wants to talk about gods and men, and he can see in the dark. A lot has changed.
</Person1><Person1>Inside, the building is not as scary as Sazed expected. It is just a normal office. A little old and dusty, but normal. There are desks, rugs on the floor, and pictures on the walls. It was a place for paperwork, not for scary Inquisitors.
</Person1><Person1>Spook leads them through many rooms. They go to a small storage room at the back. Here, Sazed sees that the dust on the floor has been moved. Someone has been here before. He asks Spook, "You've been here before?"
</Person1><Person1>Spook nods. He says Vin has been here too. Then he finds something on the floor. It's a hidden latch. A secret handle. He opens it, and they see a trapdoor. Below the door is only darkness.
</Person1><Person1>Allrianne asks what he is talking about. Breeze explains that Vin came to this city before. She was looking for something. Sazed knows what it is. As Spook climbs down a ladder into the dark, Sazed says the word: "The cache."
</Person1><Person1>And cache is our second word. A cache is a place where you hide things to keep them safe. It's like a secret storage room. The Lord Ruler built many caches all over the empire. They were full of food, water, and other supplies. They were for emergencies. And they are all hidden under Ministry buildings.
</Person1><Person1>Allrianne says, "Great! We found it. Why do we need to fight the city's leader?" Spook's voice comes from the darkness below. He says there are too many supplies. They cannot move them with the Citizen in control of the city.
</Person1><Person1>Breeze agrees. He says their job is not just to get supplies. Their job is to stop a rebellion. He thinks it feels strange. Before, they were starting rebellions. Now, they are stopping one. Spook's voice echoes again. He says maybe they can start a rebellion against the rebellion. Then he asks if they are coming down.
</Person1><Person1>Sazed and Breeze look at each other. Then Sazed picks up the lantern and climbs down the ladder. At the bottom, he finds a small stone room. One wall is open, and behind it is a huge cavern. A cavern is a very, very big cave underground.
</Person1><Person1>Sazed raises the lantern. His eyes open wide. Breeze comes down the ladder behind him and stands next to him. He whispers, "Lord Ruler! It's enormous!" The cavern is bigger than they could imagine. Spook says the Lord Ruler made these caches to help the empire survive a disaster. So, of course, they had to be very, very big.
</Person1><Person1>And "grand," or very big, was the right word. They are standing in a giant, secret cave full of supplies, hidden under the city.
</Person1><Person1>So, they have found what they were looking for. A massive, hidden supply cache. Spook knew exactly where it was. He is stronger and more mysterious than ever. But now they have a new problem. The cache is huge. It's a perfect place to hide their army and supplies. But it is also a trap. They are deep under a city that is controlled by their enemy.
</Person1><Person1>Next time, we will explore this amazing cavern. Spook will tell them more about his plan. And they will find another incredible secret down in the darkness. A secret that connects to the whole city. What could it be? Join me next time to find out.</Person1>
