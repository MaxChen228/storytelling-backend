<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we remember Spook was getting ready to go outside. His senses are so strong that the world is a very loud and bright place for him. It can be painful. So, he covers his eyes with a cloth to help him see. He must go into the city of Urteau to learn its secrets before his friends arrive.
</Person1><Person1>Now… let's join him. Can you picture it? Spook is sitting on the side of a very wide street. This place is called Marketpit. Long, long ago, it was not a street. It was a canal, a river filled with water, and big boats sailed here. Today, it is a busy market, full of people and shops. Buildings stand tall on both sides, like stone walls.
</Person1><Person1>Spook is sitting with a man named Durn. They are dressed in old, torn clothes. They look like beggars. You know, a beggar is a poor person who asks other people for money or food. Durn is talking to Spook. He softly taps the ground with two small sticks, making a quiet rhythm.
</Person1><Person1>“This is better,” Durn says. “It is better than living under the old lords.” Durn believes this new city is a happy place. He says the skaa, the common people, are finally ruling themselves. But Spook… Mmm… Spook is quiet. He looks at the crowd. He does not see happy people. He sees people with sad faces. They walk quickly. They buy what they need and leave. They do not smile or talk much. And Spook sees soldiers everywhere. They are watching everyone.
</Person1><Person1>Spook also notices something else. Everyone wears almost the same clothes. The government, called the Citizen's orders, tells people what colors and styles to wear. It is very controlled. Durn says, “Look, do you see anyone being beaten on the street? Surely that’s worth a few strict rules.” Strict rules are rules that everyone must follow, with no exceptions.
</Person1><Person1>Spook shakes his head. He speaks very softly. “The deaths happen in quiet alleys now,” he says. “At least the Lord Ruler killed us openly.” This city is not the happy place Durn sees. It is a place of fear, just a different kind of fear.
</Person1><Person1>Durn continues to tap his sticks on the ground. The rhythm is perfect. He could be a great musician. But in this city, it is not good to get attention. It is safer to be quiet, to be unnoticed. That is why Spook and Durn are pretending. Spook pretends to be blind. Durn pretends he cannot walk well. It is a disguise. In other words, it’s like they are wearing costumes. This way, no one pays attention to them. They can watch and listen to everything.
</Person1><Person1>Suddenly, Durn stops tapping. “There it is,” he says. Spook looks up. He sees soldiers in brown uniforms. They are leading a group of prisoners through the market. All the people in the market become silent. They move out of the way and bow their heads. It is a very somber moment. “You still want to follow?” Durn asks. Spook stands up. Yes. He needs to see what will happen.
</Person1><Person1>Durn stands and puts a hand on Spook’s shoulder. He pretends to guide the blind man. Together, they follow the soldiers and the prisoners. They walk away from the market, up a ramp, to a part of the city where rich people once lived. The air here smells of smoke. Spook sees the ruins of burned houses. It is a very sad sight.
</Person1><Person1>Soon, they arrive. There is a large crowd of people standing in front of a big, beautiful house. The leader of the city is there. He is called the Citizen. He is not on a horse. He says only noblemen ride horses. But he is wearing red clothes. This is very strange. Spook whispers to Durn, “Why is he wearing red?” Durn explains that, starting today, red is the new color for government officers. It helps people find them.
</Person1><Person1>Spook looks closer. He sees a young woman standing near the Citizen. It is the Citizen’s sister, Beldre. She always looks very sad. But Spook’s attention goes back to the prisoners. There are ten of them. They look just like all the other skaa in the city, with gray clothes and tired faces.
</Person1><Person1>The Citizen steps forward and speaks to the crowd in a loud voice. He points at the prisoners. He says, “These people are noblemen!” He tells the crowd that these noblemen were warned. They were told to leave the city. “But,” the Citizen shouts, “they were too arrogant to listen!”
</Person1><Person1>So, imagine the scene. Spook is in the crowd, watching. The Citizen is on the steps, angry and powerful. And ten prisoners stand there, afraid. Spook can see they are not noblemen. They are just skaa, like him. What is going to happen to them?
</Person1><Person1>Next time, we will see a terrible fire. The Citizen will do something awful to prove his power. Spook will feel helpless and angry, and he will realize that Kelsier's beautiful dream of freedom has been turned into something dark and full of hate. Join us then for the next part of the story.</Person1>
