<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Marsh as a dark power took control of his body. It forced him to do a terrible, terrible thing. Today, we leave that scene and go to a new place. A place of complete darkness, where someone is trapped.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine for a moment. You are in a small, dark pit. It is always dark, because you have no eyes. You don't have a body like a person. You are just… a mass of muscle. Soft, like a snail, but much bigger. You can't move much. The stone walls of your prison are cold and wet.
</Person1><Person1>This is life for TenSoon. He is a kandra, a very old and special creature. He can make eyes, or ears, or a whole body if he has bones to use. But here, in this pit, he has no bones. Without a skeleton, he is… impotent. That word, impotent, means powerless. He is helpless, with no way to move or act. He can only wait.
</Person1><Person1>He has been in this pit for months. Most people would go crazy from being alone in the dark for so long. But TenSoon has something called the Blessing of Presence. It keeps his mind strong. Mmm, sometimes, he wishes his mind would break. He wishes for madness, because then he wouldn't have to think about his mistakes.
</Person1><Person1>And he has made a very big mistake. He broke his people's most important rule. He told a secret. A huge secret. He believes he has doomed everyone he knows. He thinks they will all become slaves because of him. He feels so much shame. And yet… deep down, he feels he did the right thing. How can that be? How can he feel both wrong and right at the same time?
</Person1><Person1>Suddenly, he feels vibrations. Someone is coming. He feels the heavy iron grate above his pit being dragged open. What is happening? Then, sharp hooks dig into his body. They pull him out of the pit. It hurts so much. He is spilled onto the dirty floor. He can taste the old, dry food and dirt.
</Person1><Person1>Then he smells it. A sharp, terrible smell. Acid. They are going to kill him. They are going to dissolve his body until nothing is left. But before they do, they must follow the law. The law says he must have a chance to speak. So they throw something hard at him. It's a skull. A human skull.
</Person1><Person1>TenSoon works faster than he ever has. He pushes his muscles into the skull, filling it. He makes a tongue, he makes lungs. He needs to speak! The smell of acid gets stronger. He can feel it coming closer. Then, the burning starts! The acid pours over him. It sears his muscles, dissolving him piece by piece. But he doesn't stop. He works through the pain. He forms a throat. He takes a breath. And he shouts one single, powerful word.
</Person1><Person1>Judgment!
</Person1><Person1>The pouring stops. Judgment. That word means a trial. It is when leaders gather to decide if someone is guilty. By saying this word, TenSoon forces them to stop. He has demanded a trial. A voice whispers to him, "Fool. Just accept death." The voice tells him a trial will be public. Everyone will learn his secret. His punishment will be worse than death—it will be an eternity of pain.
</Person1><Person1>He knows this. He knows there is no hope for him. He has already confessed. So why? Why does he do it? The story says he has… other reasons. He whispers the word again. "Judgment."
</Person1><Person1>And that is where we leave him. TenSoon has chosen a public trial over a quick death, even though it seems like the worst possible choice. Next time, we will go to that trial. We will learn about the kandra's ancient laws, and we will hear TenSoon's surprising defense. He will stand before his people and reveal a truth that could change everything.
