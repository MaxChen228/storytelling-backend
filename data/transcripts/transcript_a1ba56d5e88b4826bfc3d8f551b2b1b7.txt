Last time, we left Gaal on a high tower. He was looking at the amazing city of Trantor. A whole planet covered in metal. He felt small and a little lost. But he was not alone for long.
(pause)
The man from the elevator, the one who helped him, points to an empty seat. Gaal sits down. The man smiles and says his name is Jerril. He asks Gaal, "First time on Trantor?" Gaal says yes. Jerril is not surprised. He says Trantor is amazing for people with a "poetic temperament." That means people who love art and beauty. But, he says, people born on Trantor… they don't like it up here. It makes them nervous.
Gaal is shocked. "Nervous? But it's glorious!" he says. It’s so beautiful! How can anyone be scared?
Imagine you lived your whole life inside. In small rooms and long hallways. You never saw the real sky. Suddenly, you are outside. There is nothing above you but open space. Wouldn't that feel… strange? Maybe even scary? Jerril explains that for Trantorians, this open space is terrifying. They bring children up here once a year, but the children just scream.
So, Gaal learns something new about Trantor. It’s a beautiful city, but its people are afraid of the open sky. They are happy living deep underground.
(pause)
Let's talk about our first word: glorious (辉煌的). Gaal uses this word two times. Glorious means wonderful, beautiful, and impressive. The view from the tower is glorious. It’s a good word to use when you see something that takes your breath away.
Jerril then asks Gaal a question. "How high up do you think we are?" Gaal guesses, "Half a mile?" Jerril laughs a little. No. They are only five hundred feet up. The elevator ride was long because most of Trantor is underground. It’s like an iceberg, Jerril says. You only see a small part on top. Most of it is hidden underneath, going down for miles. This deep city even creates its own energy. It's cheaper than atomic power.
So, Gaal thought Trantor was just a big city on a planet. Now he knows it’s a deep, underground world. A world with secrets.
(pause)
Jerril’s friendly questions start to change. His voice becomes more serious. He asks Gaal why he is on Trantor. Is he on vacation? Gaal feels he must explain. He says he is here for a job. A job with the famous scientist, Hari Seldon.
Jerril’s eyes get sharp. "Oh," he says. "Raven Seldon?"
Gaal is confused. He knows Hari Seldon, the great mathematician. But who is Raven Seldon? Jerril explains it's a nickname. A raven is a black bird, and people sometimes think they bring bad news. They call him Raven Seldon because… he predicts disaster.
Disaster? Gaal is completely astonished. He has read all of Seldon’s work. It was all about math. He asks, "What kind of disaster?" Jerril just looks at him. "Surely, you must know," he says. Now Gaal feels annoyed and a little worried. He says goodbye and leaves.
So, the friendly man on the tower was not so friendly. He was asking a lot of questions about Hari Seldon, the man Gaal came to work for. And Seldon predicts disaster. This is a big, and scary, surprise for Gaal.
(pause)
When Gaal gets back to his hotel room, another surprise is waiting for him. A man is in his room. Gaal is too startled to speak. The man is old, with bright blue eyes. Before Gaal can ask who he is, the man says, "I am Hari Seldon."
It is him! The famous scientist. In Gaal's room! Seldon explains they must work quickly. He asks Gaal about the man on the tower, Jerril. Then he tells Gaal the truth. Jerril is not just a friendly person. He is an agent for the government, for the Commission of Public Safety. He has been following Gaal since he arrived.
Why? Because Seldon predicts disaster. And the government is watching him. Watching everyone who works with him.
This brings us to our next key phrase: psychohistory (心理历史学). This is Seldon’s special branch of mathematics. It’s not about one person. It’s about how very large groups of people—billions of people—will act in the future. It uses math to predict the future of a whole society.
Seldon takes out a small computer, a calculator pad. He shows Gaal an equation. "This," he says, "is the Galactic Empire right now." Then, he starts adding things. The chance of leaders being killed. The chance of planets fighting back. Economic problems. As he adds each problem, the math on the screen changes. It grows.
Gaal, a brilliant mathematician himself, watches carefully. He understands the complex symbols. Finally, Seldon stops. "This is Trantor," he says, "three hundred years from now."
Gaal looks at the final equation. He can’t believe it. "Total destruction!" he whispers. Impossible. Trantor is the center of the galaxy! It has been safe for thousands of years. But the math… the math is clear. Seldon asks Gaal for the exact number. What is the probability—the chance—of total destruction? Gaal calculates in his head. "About 85%?" he asks.
"Not bad," Seldon says. "The actual figure is 92.5%."
So, this is the secret. This is the disaster. Hari Seldon has used psychohistory to prove that this glorious, powerful city will fall. It will be completely destroyed. And this is why the government is watching him. This knowledge is dangerous.
(pause)
So, Gaal came to Trantor for an exciting new job. But in just one day, he has learned a terrible truth. The beautiful city is doomed. The famous scientist he works for is seen as an enemy. And a government agent is following his every move. Gaal asks Seldon, "Are you in danger, sir?"
What a first day. Gaal is no longer just a tourist or a new employee. He is now part of a dangerous secret.
And the danger is closer than he thinks. Next time, Gaal’s meeting with Seldon is cut short. He is arrested. Seldon is arrested, too. They will be put on trial. But Seldon, the man who can predict the future, seems to have a plan. Did he predict his own arrest? We will find out.
