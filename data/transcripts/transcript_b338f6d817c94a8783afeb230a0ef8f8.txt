Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we were in the middle of a tense trial. Hari Seldon had just shocked everyone. He said that not just the planet Trantor, but the entire Galactic Empire, would fall. The room was full of angry shouts of "Treason!"
(pause)
Now, the trial continues. A judge tries to speak, but Hari Seldon is not finished. He speaks firmly. He says the Empire will <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈvænɪʃ">vanish. All its good things will disappear with it. All the knowledge we have will be lost. The peace and order will be gone. He paints a dark picture of the future. There will be endless wars between the stars. Trade will stop. People will die. Worlds will be alone, lost from the rest of the Galaxy.
And then, in the huge, silent room, a small voice asks a question. "Forever?"
Can you imagine that? A future so dark, and someone asks if it will last forever.
Seldon answers. He says the dark ages to come will not last forever. But they will last for thirty thousand years. That is a thousand generations of people suffering. A thousand generations without science, without art, without peace. He says, "We must fight that."
Mmm... this is the center of his plan. The judge is confused. He says, "You contradict yourself. You said you cannot stop the fall of the Empire."
And Seldon agrees. He says, "I cannot prevent the fall." But, he explains, it is not too late to make the time of darkness shorter. He says it is possible to reduce the thirty thousand years of suffering to just one thousand years. A single millennium. He says his group can do this, if they are allowed to act now.
It’s like a giant, heavy ball rolling down a hill. You cannot stop it. But maybe, just maybe, you can push it just a little. Just enough to change its path. Seldon believes this small push can remove twenty-nine thousand years of misery from human history.
So, how will he do it? The judge asks the question we are all thinking.
Seldon’s plan is simple, but huge. He wants to save the knowledge of the human race. He says that right now, one person cannot know everything. Science is too big. When society breaks, this knowledge will break into a million tiny pieces. People will know a lot about very small things, but they will not see the big picture. They will be helpless. And this knowledge, these little pieces, will be lost forever.
But, Seldon says, if we prepare now... if we make a giant summary of all knowledge... it will never be lost. Future generations can build on it. They will not have to rediscover everything. One thousand years can do the work of thirty thousand.
This project is the "Encyclopedia Galactica." His whole team, thirty thousand people and their families, are working on it. It’s a job so big, he says he will not live to see it started properly. But by the time Trantor falls, it will be complete.
Suddenly, the Chief Commissioner hits his gavel. The talking stops. Hari Seldon walks back to his seat next to Gaal. He smiles a little and asks, "How did you like the show?"
Gaal is amazed. But he is also worried. "What will happen now?" he asks. Seldon thinks the judges will try to make a private deal with him. He has studied the Chief Commissioner for years. But he admits, it is always risky to predict what one person will do.
The next day, things are very different. It is not a trial anymore. It’s a private meeting. Just Seldon, Gaal, and the five judges. They sit together at a table. They are even offered cigars. The powerful Linge Chen begins to speak. He is the real Emperor, the man with all the power.
Chen asks Seldon a cold question. He says, everyone alive now will be dead in a hundred years. So why should we care about something three hundred years in the future? He asks, "Why shouldn't I just have you executed tonight?"
(pause)
Seldon’s answer is chilling. He says that a week ago, killing him might have worked. But now? Now, the story of his trial will spread. People will lose hope. Ambitious and bad men will try to take what they can, right now. This will make the fall happen faster. He tells Chen, "Have me killed, and Trantor will fall in fifty years. And you, yourself, will die within a single year."
Chen is not scared by words. But he sees another way. He offers Seldon a choice. He asks if the Encyclopedia project must be done on Trantor. He suggests another place. A quiet planet, far away. A place where Seldon and his one hundred thousand followers can work without disturbing the Emperor's peace.
This is the choice: <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛksaɪl">exile, or death.
Let’s look at that word. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="ˈɛksaɪl">Exile. Exile is when you are sent away from your home, from your country, and you are not allowed to return. It is a punishment. Chen is offering to send Seldon and all his people far, far away.
The planet is called Terminus. Seldon notes that it is at the very edge of the Galaxy. It is very secluded. Chen gives him five minutes to decide.
What would you do? Death, or a new life on a lonely planet at the end of the universe?
Seldon thinks for a moment. Then, he says the words that change everything. "I accept exile."
Gaal is filled with joy. They are safe! They have escaped death. But he also feels a little sad. He feels that Seldon, the great Hari Seldon, has been defeated.
But has he? (soft laugh) That is the real question, isn't it? As Seldon is taken away, he seems calm. Almost too calm.
And that is where we leave them. Seldon and his followers are being sent to Terminus. It seems like a loss. But we heard Seldon call his trial a "show." Next time, we will discover the truth. Seldon will reveal to Gaal that the trial, the danger, and even the exile… were all part of his plan from the very beginning. We will learn that Terminus is not a prison, but the first step in a plan to save humanity. Thank you for listening.
