<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Spook in a very dangerous situation. The people in the city of Urteau discovered who he was. He had to run, fast, into the night. Now, our story leaves Spook and finds someone else moving through the mists.
</Person1><Person2>Picture this. We are high in the dark night air. A woman is flying through the thick, white mist. This is Vin. The mist swirls all around her. It’s like a spinning storm of white upon black. But… the mist does not touch her. It comes close, but then it seems to be pushed back. She remembers a time when the mist was friendly. A time when it felt soft on her skin. That time has passed.
</Person2><Person1>She is not wearing a mistcloak. It feels strange to be in the mists without one. But without it, she is much quieter. She wears only a black shirt and black trousers. The clothes are tight, so they make no noise in the wind. She carries no metal, except for the coins in her pouch.
</Person1><Person2>She is here for a reason. She is a spy for Elend's army. Far below, she can see the small lights of their campfires. She needs to get into the city of Fadrex. To do this, she uses her special Allomantic powers.
</Person2><Person1>She pulls out a coin. It is wrapped in a piece of cloth. She throws it down, toward the rocks below. Then, she Pushes against the coin with her power. This Push slows her down. She floats for a moment, then lands softly on a rocky ledge. So clever! The cloth around the coin stops it from making a loud sound when it hits the rock.
</Person1><Person2>She pulls the coin back into her hand. Then she moves quietly across the rock. She sees a small group of guards. They are whispering in the darkness, watching Elend's camp. They talk about the cold spring weather. But Vin does not feel the cold. Her power of pewter keeps her warm.
</Person2><Person1>She listens with another power, bronze, but hears nothing. The guards are not Allomancers. She sneaks past them easily. This is a skill from her childhood. Before, she and her brother were burglars. They had to be quiet to survive. This is an instinct. It is something Elend can never learn, even with a lot of practice.
</Person1><Person2>Once she is past the guards, she jumps into the mists again. She uses her quiet coins to move through the air. Soon, she is inside Fadrex City. She lands in a dark alley and quickly jumps to the rooftops. And… she is surprised.
</Person2><Person1>Elend had told her Fadrex was a small city. He called it… provincial. Mmm, what does that word mean? <lang xml:lang="en-US">Provincial. It means a small town, you know, something far away from the big, important capital city. Vin expected something like a village.
</Person1><Person2>But she was wrong. Fadrex is big! She sees many poor homes, called slums. She sees large mansions for the nobles. She even sees two giant keeps. Keeps are like stone castles. They are very grand, with beautiful stained-glass windows.
</Person2><Person1>Vin understands now. Elend grew up in Luthadel, the biggest city in the empire. For him, every other city seems small. He had a… skewed concept of a large city.
</Person1><Person2>A <lang xml:lang="en-US">skewed concept… that means his idea about it was unbalanced, or not quite right. Because his home was so enormous, his idea of "big" was different. But Fadrex is not a small village. It is a real, strong city.
</Person2><Person1>Vin stops on a low roof and looks at one of the keeps. The sight takes her back in time. Three years ago. She remembers attending fancy parties in buildings just like this one. She was pretending to be a noble lady, Valette. She was part of Kelsier’s plan to destroy the Final Empire.
</Person1><Person2>She thinks about that time. She was a nervous, uncertain girl. But she was also… content. Maybe the most content she has ever been. She loved learning Allomancy. She loved laughing with her friends, the crew. They had a big challenge, but they didn't have the heavy weight of leadership. Not like now.
</Person2><Person1>Somehow, she grew up. She became a woman between the fall of kings and the collapse of worlds. She used to be afraid of change. Now, her fears are bigger. She worries about the future of all people if she fails.
</Person1><Person2>She shakes the thoughts away and gets back to work. She moves across the city, making notes of the city’s defenses and soldiers. She also looks at the living conditions. Elend hoped the city would be struggling. He hoped a siege would make them surrender.
</Person2><Person1>But Vin sees no signs of this. The streets are clean. Many noble homes are still full. The people did not run away from the army. Fadrex does not look weak. It looks stable and prepared.
</Person1><Person2>So, Vin has learned something very important tonight. Fadrex is stronger than they thought. Its leader, Lord Yomen, is keeping the city in order. How can Elend’s army win? Vin needs more information. She must find a weakness.
</Person2><Person1>And in our next chapter, she will try to find one. She is going to meet an informant, a strange old man named Slowswift. But there is a bigger surprise. Even with an army at the gates, Lord Yomen is hosting a grand ball. Tonight. What will Vin discover? We will find out next time. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
