<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left the Foundation in a very difficult place. Anacreon's envoy demanded they give up their land, and their leader, Dr. Pirenne, had no answer. It seemed like their world, Terminus, was lost. But someone else was thinking, watching, and waiting for the right moment.
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… picture the scene. The tense dinner is over. The envoy from Anacreon, Haut Rodric, is about to leave. He is feeling very powerful. Dr. Pirenne is red with anger, but he is silent. The air is thick with frustration. And then, a new voice speaks. It’s Salvor Hardin, the mayor of Terminus City. He speaks calmly, almost innocently. He asks a simple question. "Could Anacreon supply us with plutonium for our nuclear-power plant?"
</Person1><Person1>Pirenne cannot believe what he is hearing! He makes a shocked sound. But then, there is a long, dead silence. The powerful envoy, Rodric, suddenly looks… different. His voice is not strong anymore. It’s quiet, and maybe a little scared. "You have nuclear power?" he asks. Hardin just smiles. Of course they do, he says. It's old technology. But getting plutonium is a little difficult. Rodric doesn't know what to say. He quickly says goodbye and leaves. He seems very uncomfortable. What just happened? It feels like the whole room has changed with just one question.
</Person1><Person1>As soon as Rodric is gone, Pirenne explodes with anger at Hardin. He thinks Hardin has made them a military target by talking about nuclear power! But Hardin is not worried. He grins. He explains that his question was a test. A very important test. And Rodric failed it. You see, Hardin had a strong suspicion, a strong feeling, that Anacreon didn't have nuclear power anymore. And Rodric’s reaction proved it. He didn’t know that modern power plants don’t use plutonium. It’s an ancient method. This means Anacreon, and probably the other kingdoms nearby, are going backward. They are losing their best technology. Hardin murmurs to himself, looking at the stars, "Back to oil and coal, are they?" This is a huge discovery. Anacreon is not as strong as they pretend to be.
</Person1><Person1>Now, Hardin needs to make the leaders of the Foundation understand this new reality. But they don't listen to him. He is just a mayor, a politician. They are the important scientists. So, Hardin uses his power in another way. He is very clever. He controls the city's newspaper, the Journal. Soon, the newspaper starts writing articles. It says the city needs a voice in the government. People start to demand it. Finally, with very ill grace, which means he was not happy about it, Pirenne agrees. Hardin gets a seat at the Board of Trustees meeting.
</Person1><Person1>Let's talk about a word from that first scene. Hardin asked his question ingenuously. The word is in-gen-u-ous-ly. It means to do something in a very simple and honest way, like a child who doesn't know any better. Hardin wasn't really being simple, of course. He was pretending. He acted like he was just asking for help, but really, he was setting a trap for Rodric. It’s a wonderful example of using words as a tool, not just for talking, but for finding out secret information.
</Person1><Person1>So, Hardin is finally in the big meeting. He sits at a long table with the five leaders of the Foundation. These men, he thinks, are great scientists, but very poor administrators. They don't understand people. Pirenne starts the meeting with what he thinks is wonderful news. Lord Dorwin, the Chancellor of the Empire, is coming to Terminus! Pirenne is so happy. He believes the Chancellor will hear their problems and the powerful Empire will save them from Anacreon. He looks at Hardin, expecting him to be impressed.
</Person1><Person1>But Hardin is not impressed. He asks a simple question again. "What do you expect Lord Dorwin to do?" The scientists are annoyed. How can he question the Empire? They say the Emperor will protect his rights. But Hardin keeps pushing. "How?" he asks. The Emperor is thousands of light-years away. Anacreon is right here, and they have the navy. Hardin tells them plainly: "We have to fight with guns, not with words." He reminds them that Anacreon only left them alone for two months because of the lie about nuclear weapons. They will soon discover the truth. They need to prepare for a real fight. They need to build weapons.
</Person1><Person1>The board members are horrified. Build weapons? That is politics! They are a scientific foundation. Their only job is the Encyclopedia. One of them says that building weapons would take valuable men away from the Encyclopedia project. And Pirenne agrees. "The Encyclopedia first—always." Hardin can't believe it. He tries to explain that there are a million people on Terminus. They care about their homes, their farms, their lives! The Encyclopedia is not the most important thing to them. But the board members shout him down. "The Encyclopedia first!"
</Person1><Person1>And that’s when Hardin finally lets his own anger show. He tells them they aren't even real scientists anymore. Real scientists discover new things, they move forward. But what are they doing? They are just sitting here, classifying the work of people who died a thousand years ago. He says they are happy to stagnate. Let's look at that word: stag-nate. To stagnate means to stop moving, to stop growing or changing. Think of a pond where the water doesn't move. It becomes still and dirty. Hardin is saying the Foundation, and the whole Galaxy, has become like that still, dirty water. They are not creating, only remembering. And that, he shouts, is why everything is breaking down. That’s why worlds are losing nuclear power and going back to barbarism. It's a powerful, and very dangerous, thing to say.
</Person1><Person1>So, we see the real conflict isn't just between Terminus and Anacreon. It's inside Terminus itself. It's a fight between the old ways and the new. Pirenne and the Board are looking to the past—to the Emperor and their old mission. Hardin is looking at the present reality and trying to build a future. He sees that they must change to survive. But will they listen? And what will happen when the Chancellor, Lord Dorwin, arrives? Will he be the savior Pirenne hopes for? Perhaps the answer isn't with the Emperor at all. You see, the Foundation is about to celebrate its 50th anniversary, and on that day, a special vault created by the great scientist Hari Seldon is set to open. Some believe Seldon predicted all of this, and that the solution to their crisis is waiting inside. We will find out very soon. Join me next time.</Person1>
