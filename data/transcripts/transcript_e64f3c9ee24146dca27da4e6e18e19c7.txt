Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Dr. Seldon made a deal. He chose exile, a life away from home, to save his big project, the Encyclopedia. Now, he and his young friend Gaal are on their way back to the University, and everything is about to change.
Imagine you are in a small taxi. It is moving fast through dark, long tunnels under the giant city of Trantor. The only sound is a high, whining noise from the taxi's engine. For a long, long time, Seldon and Gaal sit in silence.
Finally, Gaal speaks. He is worried. He asks Seldon,  "Was it true? What you told the Commissioner? If they killed you, would the Empire really fall faster?"
Seldon sounds very calm. "I never lie about my science," he says. "He knew it was true. Linge Chen is a very smart politician. He can feel when something is true."
Gaal is still confused. "Then... why did you accept exile? Why did you agree to leave?" (pause) But Seldon does not answer.
Suddenly, the taxi bursts out of the tunnel. Light is everywhere! Gaal feels weak. He almost forgot that a sun existed. He can’t even walk properly. Someone has to help him out of the taxi. The University buildings are not dark steel like the rest of the city. They are a beautiful, silvery color, almost like ivory. It’s a completely different world.
So, after the dark tunnels, they arrive at a place full of light and beautiful buildings. It feels like a safe place, a place of knowledge. But it is not.
Seldon looks around and says quietly, "Soldiers, it seems."
Gaal looks down and sees a guard standing there. A captain comes out from a doorway. He is polite, but his words are heavy. He asks, "Dr. Seldon?"
"Yes," Seldon replies.
The captain's message is cold and clear. "You and your men are now under martial law. This means the army is in control. You have six months to prepare to leave for Terminus."
"Six months!" Gaal shouts. He is shocked.
But Seldon puts a hand on his arm, a gentle pressure that says, be quiet. The captain just repeats, "These are my instructions," and then he is gone.
Gaal turns to Seldon, his voice full of fear. "What can we do in six months? This is just a slower way to kill us!"
"Quietly," Seldon says. "Let's go to my office."
This is a really important moment, isn't it? They thought they had time, but now the army is here, and they only have six months. The word the captain used is important. He said they were under martial law.
(pause)
Let's look at that phrase. Martial Law (戒嚴法 jièyánfǎ). Martial law is when the army takes control of a place instead of the police or the government. It usually happens during a war or a big emergency. So, when the captain says this, he means Seldon and his team have lost their freedom. The soldiers are in charge now.
So, they are under martial law, with only six months to prepare for a journey to the edge of the galaxy.
They go to Seldon's office. It's a special office. It is spy-proof. This means nobody can listen to what they say inside. Seldon sits down, looking very relaxed. "Now," he says, "six months will be enough."
Gaal can't believe it. "How?" he asks.
Seldon smiles a little. "My boy," he says, "our plan is so big that it makes other people do what we need them to do. We studied Commissioner Chen very, very carefully. We knew how he would react. We planned this."
"You... you planned to be exiled to Terminus?" Gaal asks, his eyes wide.
"Why not?" Seldon says. He touches a secret spot on his desk, and a part of the wall slides open. Inside, there are small microfilms. "Take the one with the letter T," Seldon tells Gaal.
Gaal puts the microfilm into a projector and watches. He is completely shocked. "You... you have been preparing this for two years?"
"Two and a half years," Seldon says calmly. "We hoped he would choose Terminus, so we planned for it."
This is the big secret, you see. Seldon wasn't defeated. He wasn't forced into exile. He planned it all. He wanted to go to Terminus.
But why? Gaal asks the same question. "Why? Why not stay here on Trantor, where you can control things?"
Seldon explains a little. On Terminus, they can get support from the Empire without making the Empire afraid. And, he adds, maybe twenty thousand families would not want to travel to the end of the galaxy on their own. They needed to be forced.
Let's pause on that word, exile. Exile (流放 liúfàng). Exile is when you are forced to leave your home and live in another place, often far away. Seldon accepted exile, but now we know he actually wanted it. It was part of his plan. It's like needing to move to a new city for a very important job that nobody else understands.
So, Seldon wanted the exile. He needed everyone to go to Terminus. But Gaal still doesn't understand the final reason.
"May I not know?" he asks.
Seldon looks at him kindly. "Not yet," he says. He tells Gaal that they are building a safe place for science on Terminus. And... another one. At the other end of the galaxy. A secret place he calls "Star's End."
Then Seldon shares something very personal. "I will die soon," he says. "My doctors say I have only a year or two left. But that's okay. I have done what I wanted to do in my life."
He explains that after he dies, others will continue the work. People like Gaal. They will finish the plan. The real plan is not just about the Encyclopedia. It's about starting something new, something that will happen long after Seldon is gone.
Gaal is lost. "I do not understand," he says.
Seldon's face looks old and tired, but peaceful. "You will," he says. Then he whispers, so quietly Gaal can barely hear him, "I am finished."
(pause)
What an ending to his part of the story. Seldon has set everything in motion. His life's work is done, and now it's up to others to carry it forward.
The story then moves to the future, to the planet Terminus. It is a lonely planet at the very edge of the galaxy. For centuries, nobody lived there. But now, it is the home of the Encyclopedists. It is the beginning of a new chapter, not just for them, but for the entire galaxy.
And what happens next? Well, a new generation grows up on Terminus. They face new problems. The Empire is far away and getting weaker. A powerful neighbor, Anacreon, declares itself a kingdom. Suddenly, Terminus is cut off and in danger. The new mayor, a man named Salvor Hardin, sees the threat. But the leader of the Encyclopedia project, Lewis Pirenne, only cares about science. He believes the Empire will protect them. Who is right? And what will happen when a special envoy from Anacreon arrives to inspect their new, small world? We'll find out next time.</Person1>
