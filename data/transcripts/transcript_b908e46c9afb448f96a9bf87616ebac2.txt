<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). I’m so glad you are here with us.
Last time, we left Spook in a very difficult place. He was fighting the Citizen’s soldiers. And then, he discovered a terrible secret. The Citizen, Quellion, is an Allomancer. He has special powers. He used his power to stop Spook’s sword in the middle of the air. Spook is now facing a powerful enemy, and he has no weapon. What can he do?
Let’s see what happens next.
The sword is frozen in the air. Spook knows he cannot win this fight. So, he makes a very quick decision. He lets go of his sword. It flies backward, away from him. At the same moment, he throws himself down onto the ground.  Mmm, that was a close one. He feels the air move just above him. An enemy’s sword swings right where his head was. It misses him by only a little bit.
Can you picture it? Spook is on the cold ground. He can hear his own sword hit the stone floor a short distance away. The sound is very loud in his ears. It’s a ringing sound. But there is no time to rest. There is no time to even take a deep breath. He must move. He pushes himself up to dodge another attack from the soldier. He has to avoid the next swing of the sword.
Spook has one small bit of luck. He is not wearing any metal. This is very important. Quellion is an Allomancer who can Push on metal. If Spook wore metal armor, Quellion could push him around easily. But Spook never liked wearing metal. And now, that old habit is saving him. You know, sometimes small habits can make a big difference.
Spook understands his situation. He cannot fight. Not when an Allomancer is helping the soldiers. There is only one choice for him. He has to run.
So, he turns. The soldier is getting ready for another swing. Spook doesn’t run away. Instead, he does something surprising. He runs forward. He runs right toward the soldier. He gets inside the soldier's guard, which means he gets very close, where the sword is not useful. He ducks under the man’s arm and then runs to the side. He hopes the soldier will be confused. He hopes to just run past him.
But then… something catches his foot.
He spins around, falling. At first, he thinks it must be Quellion again. Maybe Quellion is using another power, a power to Pull things. But no. He looks down and sees what grabbed him. It’s the first soldier. The one Spook hit on the head two times. The soldier he thought was unconscious. Spook is so frustrated. He thinks, “I hit that man in the head twice! How is he still awake?”
The hand on his foot squeezes. It pulls him backward with… an inhuman strength. That is, a strength that is not normal for a person. And Spook understands. This man is a Thug.
Let’s pause here for a moment. This word, Thug, is very important in this story. A Thug is not just a bad person. A Thug is a type of Allomancer. They can burn a metal called pewter. When they burn pewter, their bodies become much, much stronger. They can run faster, fight harder, and heal from injuries that would stop a normal person. So, when Spook says the soldier is a Thug, he means he is fighting someone with superpowers.
So, to recap this part: Spook tried to run, but was caught by a soldier he thought was defeated. This soldier has amazing strength, and Spook realizes he is a Thug, a powerful Allomancer.
Spook is in serious trouble now. He kicks hard and breaks free from the hand. He stumbles but gets back on his feet. But he knows a Thug can run faster than him. A Thug can run longer than him. He cannot escape by running.
And he thinks, “Two Allomancers.” First, the Citizen, Quellion. And now, this soldier, a Thug. Spook feels a flash of anger. Quellion always says he hates the nobles and their Allomantic powers. But he uses Allomancers in his own army. Mmm… I can’t help questioning Quellion’s words. He says one thing, but he does another.
Now, the two soldiers are moving toward him. The Thug and the other soldier. Spook feels his heart beating very fast. It’s like a drum. Thump, thump, thump. He yells with frustration. And then he does another surprising thing. He throws himself at the Thug. He grapples the man, which means he holds onto him to fight up close. The Thug is surprised by this.
In that moment of confusion, Spook spins the Thug around. He uses the Thug’s body as a shield. A shield is something you use to protect yourself. He is hoping the other soldier won’t attack his friend.
But Spook did not understand Quellion’s soldiers. The Citizen always talks about sacrifice. He says sometimes, people must be sacrificed for a greater good. And his soldiers believe this. The third soldier does not hesitate. He rams his sword forward. The sword goes straight through his friend’s back. It pierces the Thug’s heart. And then… the sword goes directly into Spook’s chest.
It was a move that needed incredible strength and precision. Only a person with the power of pewter could do that. Only a Thug.
And as Spook stands there, dazed, with a sword through him, he has one last thought. “Three Allomancers.” The Citizen. The first soldier. And now this soldier, too. All three of them were Allomancers. He wonders, “How did I even survive this long?” He realizes they must have been hiding their powers. They were trying to seem like normal soldiers.
Spook stumbles backward. He can feel warm blood on his chest. But… it’s strange. He doesn’t feel any pain. His senses are enhanced by tin. They are very strong. The pain should be terrible. It should be so powerful…
And then, it hits him.
Everything goes black.
So, in this chapter, Spook’s desperate fight comes to a shocking end. He discovers that he was not fighting one or two Allomancers, but three. He is betrayed, used as a shield, and then stabbed through the chest. His world fades to black.
Spook’s story pauses here, in darkness. But the world is much larger. In another place, a leader named Elend is preparing his army for a different kind of test. He must lead his soldiers into the dangerous mists. The mists can kill people. But if you survive, you become immune, stronger. Elend must pretend to be confident, but he is worried. He knows some of his people will die. Why is this dangerous step so important? And what does his general, Demoux, believe about their god, the Survivor?
