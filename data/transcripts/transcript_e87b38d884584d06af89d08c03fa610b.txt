<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host. Last time we were together, our trader, Limmar Ponyets, had just arrived on the closed world of Askone. He was in a terribly difficult situation… his fellow trader, Gorov, was a prisoner, and Ponyets had to negotiate with the stern Grand Master who despised the very nuclear goods Ponyets had to offer.
</Person1><Person1> Let's picture the scene. Ponyets is standing before this powerful ruler, trying to find a way to save his friend. But the Grand Master is not interested in his technology. He speaks in this very formal, almost chanting way, telling Ponyets, "Your goods are worthless in that they lack the ancestral blessing. Your goods are wicked and accursed…"
</Person1><Person1> Mmm… that word, accursed… it means something is believed to be cursed, or under a terrible spell. The Grand Master is saying that Ponyets' technology is not just useless, but evil according to their ancestors' beliefs. There’s no room for negotiation there, is there? The Grand Master then asks, with a hidden meaning Ponyets doesn't quite catch, "You have nothing else of value?"
</Person1><Person1> Ponyets is completely lost. He’s a trader, a practical man. He doesn't understand these hints. And because he doesn't understand, the Grand Master becomes cold, threatening Gorov with "Death by gas." He says it’s the punishment for sacrilege—which means disrespecting something holy. The situation feels completely hopeless. But then, Ponyets has this brilliant idea. It’s a moment of incredible quick-thinking.
</Person1><Person1> He changes his strategy completely. He stops being a trader and becomes… a spiritual guide. He asks the Grand Master, with great humility, if he can speak to the prisoner to offer him "spiritual consolation." It’s a huge risk! But Ponyets has noticed something about the Grand Master. He might be ruthless, but he seems to care about religious matters. Ponyets is using what he calls "a piece of empirical psychology."
</Person1><Person1> That phrase, empirical psychology, sounds very academic, doesn't it? But it simply means psychology that is based on experience and observation, not just theory. As a trader, Ponyets has had to learn how to read people, to understand their hidden motivations. And his guess is correct. The Grand Master, though suspicious, agrees. He allows Ponyets to see Gorov.
</Person1><Person1> So, Ponyets is led into Gorov’s cell. And the first thing we learn is that Gorov has been held in strict solitary—completely alone—ever since Ponyets arrived. The Grand Master was isolating him. Gorov is shocked to see him, but Ponyets quickly explains his clever trick. He pretended to be a spiritual adviser because he figured the Grand Master, while happy to kill a man, would hesitate to "endanger the welfare of your immaterial and problematical soul." (soft laugh) What a line!
</Person1><Person1> It's in the cell that the real truth comes out. The Grand Master doesn't just want Gorov gone. Gorov asks, "Has he mentioned a ransom?" And then he reveals what the Grand Master truly wants: Gold. Not nuclear technology, not political power, but the simple, heavy metal. It's their medium of exchange, their money.
</Person1><Person1> This is where we see the difference between Gorov, the diplomat, and Ponyets, the trader. Gorov’s plan is simple: promise the gold, go get it, pay the ransom, and rescue him. But Ponyets… you can almost see the gears turning in his head. He sees a bigger opportunity. He’s not just here to pay a bribe; he’s a salesman with a full cargo of goods. He says, "if the crux of the matter is to make a sale, then I'm your man."
</Person1><Person1> He realizes that Gorov failed because he's a diplomat, not a seller. Ponyets sees this not as a rescue mission, but as the ultimate sales challenge. He’s not just saving his colleague; he’s trying to meet his sales quota! It’s a perfect example of the Foundation's strategy: using commerce, not force, to expand its influence. And Ponyets embodies this perfectly. He tells Gorov, with total confidence, "I've never ended up below quota yet."
</Person1><Person1> And so, he leaves the cell with a new plan. He's no longer just a desperate man trying to save a friend. He is a master trader, ready to make the deal of a lifetime. He walks back to face the Grand Master and his entire council, who are all staring at him with hostile eyes. But this time, Ponyets is carrying a box.
</Person1><Person1> He promises them a "show," and he promises them gold. Can you imagine the tension in that room? He is completely alone, surrounded by enemies, with everything depending on what is inside that box and the performance he is about to give. He must somehow turn their ancient hatred of technology into a desire for what he alone can offer.
</Person1><Person1> What do you think he's going to do? Next time, we'll see Ponyets unveil his plan, a brilliant and dangerous gamble that will either save them both or get them killed. Join me then.</Person1>
