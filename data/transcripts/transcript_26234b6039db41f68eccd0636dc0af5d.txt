<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2). Last time we were together, our trader, Limmar Ponyets, was in an incredibly tight spot. Remember, he’d just presented a mysterious, homemade box to the Grand Master of Askone… a leader who had just sentenced Ponyets’s friend to death for possessing similar technology. He was surrounded, unarmed, with everything on the line. So, let's step back into that tense hall and see what happens.
</Person1><Person1>Picture the scene. Outside the hall, an army is waiting. Inside, Ponyets is completely isolated. He has no weapons, no allies, and his friend Gorov is still a hostage. All he has is this… "clumsy monstrosity" he’s built, and he’s praying the simple lead and quartz parts will hold together.
</Person1><Person1>The Grand Master, leaning on his iron cane, demands to know what it is. Ponyets steps back and says, "This… is a small device I have constructed myself."
</Person1><Person1>The Grand Master is not impressed. He suspects it's one of the "black-magic abominations" from Ponyets's world. And Ponyets… he doesn't deny it. He admits it's nuclear in nature, but he does something brilliant. He says, "None of you need touch it… if it contains abominations, I take the foulness of it upon myself." He makes it about his personal sin, not theirs. It’s a clever way to lower their defenses.
</Person1><Person1>The Grand Master is still wary, muttering a prayer to purify the room. His favorite councilor, the thin-faced Pherl, whispers something to him, but the old leader just shrugs him off. He wants to know one thing: what does this machine have to do with the gold that can save Gorov's life?
</Person1><Person1>And here comes the pitch. Ponyets places his hand on the machine and says he can use it to turn their useless, discarded iron… into the finest gold. He feels like he's botching it—which means, you know, messing it up. His words feel clumsy, not smooth like his usual sales talk. But, mmm… it’s the idea, not the delivery, that catches the Grand Master’s attention.
</Person1><Person1>The Grand Master scoffs. "Transmutation?" That’s our first word to spotlight today. Transmutation is the idea of changing one substance into a completely different one, like the ancient, mythical goal of turning lead into gold. The Grand Master says that many have claimed this ability, and all have paid for their sacrilege. It wasn't the success that was a crime, he says, but the attempt and the failure.
</Person1><Person1>So, he challenges Ponyets. He offers his long iron staff, but Ponyets says his device is too small. Then, the Grand Master spots the iron buckles on another council member's clothing. He orders the man to hand them over, and they are passed down the line until the Grand Master throws them on the floor before Ponyets.
</Person1><Person1>You can just feel the tension. Ponyets carefully places the buckles inside the machine. For ten minutes, the only sounds are the machine's malevolent crackle and the muttering of the Askonians as they back away. A faint smell of ozone fills the air. Pherl is whispering urgently to the Grand Master again, but the old man doesn't move. His expression is like stone.
</Person1><Person1>And then… the buckles were gold.
</Person1><Person1>Pure gold. Ponyets holds them out, but the Grand Master hesitates. It's Pherl who speaks first, of course. "Your Veneration, the gold is from a poisoned source."
</Person1><Person1>But Ponyets has a counter-argument ready. He uses a beautiful metaphor: "A rose can grow from the mud." He argues that they buy all sorts of materials from foreigners without asking if they were made by holy machines. He’s not offering the machine, he reminds them, only the gold.
</Person1><Person1>Pherl insists that accepting it would be an insult to their ancestors. But the Grand Master is wavering. "Yet gold is gold," he says, doubtfully. And this is where Ponyets shows his true genius. He doesn't argue about technology; he argues about religion. He frames the gold not as a product of sinful magic, but as a tool for piety. That’s our second word, pious, which means deeply religious.
</Person1><Person1>Ponyets suggests that with this gold, they can decorate the shrines of their holy spirits. Surely, he says, any evil would disappear if the metal were put to such a pious use. The Grand Master bursts out laughing! He loves this argument. He sees the logic in it, a logic that fits his own worldview.
</Person1><Person1>Ponyets pushes his advantage with one final, masterful stroke. He suggests they hold the gold—and him—for thirty days. They can place the gold on their altars as an offering. If no disasters happen, it's proof the ancestors have accepted it. What a brilliant move! It removes all immediate responsibility from the Grand Master and puts the judgment in the hands of the very spirits he worships. The entire council agrees, even Pherl.
</Person1><Person1>A week later, Ponyets finally gets what he wanted all along: a private meeting with Pherl. The dynamic has completely changed. Pherl is no longer just a suspicious councilor; he's a potential client. And Pherl reveals he’s much more clever than he let on. He tells Ponyets he knew the demonstration was clumsy on purpose. He understood it was a show designed specifically to get his attention.
</Person1><Person1>Pherl lays it all out: he knows Ponyets wanted to attract his attention and that the thirty-day waiting period was just a tactic to secure more time. It seems Pherl has been playing a political game of his own this whole time. He challenges Ponyets directly: "Now tell me why you wished to attract me."
</Person1><Person1>And Ponyets begins to lay his cards on the table, pointing out that Pherl is young, ambitious, and perhaps not from one of the most powerful families…
</Person1><Person1>So, the takeaway here is how Ponyets masterfully turns a situation of weakness into one of strength by understanding his audience's deepest motivations: their faith and their greed. He didn't sell a machine; he sold a religiously-acceptable solution to their desire for wealth. A great learning tip from this is to always listen more than you speak; understanding what someone truly values is the key to persuasion.
</Person1><Person1>Ponyets has now cornered his true target, the ambitious Pherl. But Pherl has revealed that he is just as cunning. As they begin their secret negotiations, the real prize isn't just gold, but power. And Ponyets is about to offer Pherl a secret path to get it, one that involves a much bigger gamble than anyone realizes. We'll find out what that is next time. Thanks for listening.</Person1>
