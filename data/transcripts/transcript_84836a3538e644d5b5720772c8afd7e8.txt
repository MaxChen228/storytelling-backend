<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we felt the deep sadness of a young boy named Spook. Remember how his own family abandoned him? He had to choose a new name, Lestibournes, which means “I have been abandoned.” Today, we will see another character, TenSoon, face his own impossible choice. But first, we learn a shocking secret about a great hero.
</Person1><Person1>We all remember Kelsier. We thought he was the hero who found a secret, the Eleventh Metal, to save everyone. But now, we learn the truth. And the truth is very dark. It seems Kelsier’s stories about the metal were not true. They were a trick. A terrible, clever power named Ruin made them up.
</Person1><Person1>You see, Ruin wanted to kill the Lord Ruler. But Ruin is subtle, which means it works in quiet, secret ways. So, it needed someone else to do the work. It needed a pawn... someone it could use like a piece in a game. It chose Kelsier. Ruin manipulated him.
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… to be manipulated is when someone secretly makes you do what they want. They trick you for their own reasons. Ruin tricked Kelsier into killing the Lord Ruler so that Ruin could be free. So, even the people's greatest victory… was really a victory for this dark power. It’s a sad and scary thought, isn't it?
</Person1><Person1>Now, let’s leave that dark secret for a moment. Let’s go deep, deep underground. Can you picture a cold, large cavern? In the middle of this cavern, there is a small cage. And inside this cage sits TenSoon. TenSoon is a kandra, a creature who can change his shape by using different bones. But right now, he is trapped. He is a prisoner of his own people.
</Person1><Person1>Days ago, his friend MeLaan said something to him. Her words still prick his conscience. Your conscience is that little voice inside you, the feeling that tells you if you are doing something right or wrong. MeLaan’s words made TenSoon’s conscience hurt. She said, "You come, tell us terrible news, and then you leave us to solve the problems?"
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… TenSoon feels this deeply. He broke his people's most important rule, their Contract, to help his human friend, Vin. He thought accepting his punishment was the right thing to do. The honorable thing. But now, sitting in his cage forever feels like the easy way out. He would be avoiding the world's problems. Just like the leaders of his people.
</Person1><Person1>But what can he do? He feels the earth shake sometimes. The end of the world could be near. Vin needs to know the truth about the kandra. But telling her more would be an even bigger betrayal. He feels so stuck. He closes his eyes in the cold cage. Escape seems impossible. The cage is strong. The guards have a special power called the Blessing of Potency, which makes them very strong and fast. He is weak. He has no way to fight or run.
</Person1><Person1>And, you know, in a strange way, this is a comfort. It’s a relief. If escape is impossible, then he doesn't have to make the terrible choice between his people and his friend. The choice is already made for him. Or so he thinks.
</Person1><Person1>One day, he sees motion. Guards are coming to his cage. It’s not time for his trial! What is happening? One guard carries a large sack. For a second, TenSoon feels a flash of panic. But the sack looks full already. The guard opens the cage and throws the sack inside. It makes a familiar sound. Clink. Clink. Bones.
</Person1><Person1>The guard tells him the plan. The leaders want to have a public punishment. They are going to break his bones in front of everyone. TenSoon’s stomach twists. He can heal, yes, but he feels pain just like a human. It will be horrible. And the new bones? The guard says they don't want to waste the good human bones he is wearing now.
</Person1><Person1>So, what is in the sack? TenSoon pulls out a leg bone. It is not human. It belongs to a large dog… a wolfhound. It is the very body he was wearing when he returned home. The guard smiles. To the kandra leaders, forcing TenSoon to wear an animal's body is the ultimate insult. It is meant to degrade him, to show that he is less than a true kandra.
</Person1><Person1>The guard laughs as he leaves. He says, “When your punishment comes, everyone will see you for what you really are.” But the guard has no idea what he has just done. TenSoon holds the smooth dog bone. He remembers something. A week ago, he spoke loudly about how much he despised these bones. He hoped the leaders’ spies would hear him. He was counting on their traditions, on their desire to humiliate him.
</Person1><Person1>(soft laugh) That was exactly his plan. He tricked them. The guard thinks he has given TenSoon an insult. But what he has really given him… is the key to his escape. 
</Person1><Person1>So, TenSoon now has a chance. He turned his enemy's plan into his own hope. It shows us that even in the darkest moments, a clever mind can find a way out. And speaking of being trapped… Elend and his army have just arrived at a fortified city named Fadrex. But as they prepare for a fight, they realize the river they used to travel is now blocked with ash. There is no going back. They are stranded. What will they do, trapped in front of an enemy city? We will find out… next time. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
