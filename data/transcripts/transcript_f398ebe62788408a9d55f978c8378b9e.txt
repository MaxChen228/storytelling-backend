<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Gaal Dornick and Hari Seldon in a very difficult place. They were both arrested, and Gaal learned that Seldon had planned for it all to happen. Now, the trial begins. Let’s step into the courtroom and see what happens to Hari Seldon. 
</Person1><Person1> Can you picture the room? It’s a serious place. High up, behind a big desk, sit five men. They are the judges, the Commission of Public Safety. They wear important uniforms, scarlet and gold. On their heads, they have shiny plastic caps. This shows everyone they have power. In the very center is the most important one, the Chief Commissioner, Linge Chen. Gaal has never seen such a powerful man. He just watches him, amazed. Linge Chen is very quiet. Mmm… he never speaks. He acts like speaking is for other, less important people. It’s a way to show his power, you know? He feels talking is beneath his dignity. 
</Person1><Person1> Let’s talk about that phrase, "beneath his dignity." It means he thinks he is too important to do something. For Linge Chen, speaking during the trial is something for others to do. He is above it. It tells us he is very, very proud. So, the room is quiet and full of tension. The judges are watching. And Hari Seldon is there, ready to answer questions. 
</Person1><Person1> The lawyer for the Commission, the Advocate, starts asking questions. He looks at his notes. "Dr. Seldon," he asks, "how many people are in your project?" Seldon answers simply, "Fifty mathematicians." The Advocate pushes him. "What about Dr. Gaal Dornick?" Seldon explains Gaal will be the fifty-first. The Advocate smiles a little. (soft laugh) He tries to make Seldon look confused. "Are you sure? Maybe fifty-two? Or more?" But Seldon is calm. He says, "No. When Gaal joins, it will be fifty-one. Right now, it is fifty." 
</Person1><Person1> The Advocate then asks a surprising question. He asks if there are almost one hundred thousand people. Seldon says, "Not mathematicians, no." The Advocate gets a little louder. He says he means everyone, in all jobs. He says the number is exactly ninety-eight thousand, five hundred and seventy-two. Seldon has a simple answer for this. He says, "I believe you are counting women and children." The Advocate gets angry. His voice is loud now. He says, "There is no need to quibble." 
</Person1><Person1> And that’s our second phrase for today: "to quibble." To quibble means to argue about very small, unimportant details. The Advocate doesn't care if they are men, women, or children. He only cares about the total number. He thinks Seldon is playing with words. But Seldon agrees to the number. He is not fighting. He is just very calm and clear. So, in this part of the trial, the Advocate tries to make Seldon look like a liar, but Seldon stays calm and truthful. 
</Person1><Person1> Now, the Advocate changes the topic. He asks Seldon to repeat his idea about the future of Trantor. Seldon does not hesitate. He says it again, clearly. "Trantor will be in ruins within three centuries." Just imagine saying that in front of the most powerful people in the galaxy! The Advocate asks if this is disloyal. Seldon’s answer is wonderful. He says, "Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty." It’s just the truth. It’s not good or bad, loyal or disloyal. It just… is. 
</Person1><Person1> The Advocate then asks Seldon to prove his math. Seldon says he can only prove it to another mathematician. The Advocate smiles, thinking he has caught Seldon. He says, "So your truth is a secret? Only special people can understand it?" He thinks truth should be simple for everyone. But Seldon has a great example. He talks about how a power engine works. He says even very intelligent people here might not know how to build one. Does that mean the science is not true? Of course not. Some truths are just complex. He was about to say the Commissioners might not understand, but one of them whispers to the Advocate. The Advocate’s face turns red. He quickly stops Seldon from talking. 
</Person1><Person1> The trial is getting more intense now, isn't it? The Advocate is trying to trap Seldon, but Seldon always has a calm, logical answer. He is not afraid of their power. He only cares about the truth of his science. 
</Person1><Person1> Now the Advocate makes a serious accusation. He suggests Seldon is predicting disaster just to scare people. He suggests Seldon wants to create an army of one hundred thousand people to take power. Seldon simply says, "That is not so." He explains that very few of them are old enough to be soldiers, and none of them know how to fight. The Advocate asks if he is working for someone else. Seldon says no. He is only serving science. 
</Person1><Person1> Then comes the most important question. The Advocate asks, "Can the future be changed?" Seldon says yes, but it is very, very difficult. He uses an idea called inertia. Think of a huge, heavy ball. It is very hard to start moving it, and it is very hard to stop it. The future of billions of people is like that giant ball. A small group of people cannot change its direction easily. The Advocate thinks he understands. He asks, "So even your one hundred thousand people cannot stop Trantor's destruction?" Seldon agrees. "You are unfortunately correct." 
</Person1><Person1> (pause) And here, the Advocate thinks he has won. He speaks slowly now, enjoying his moment. He says, "In that case, Dr. Seldon… if your people cannot stop the destruction, and they are not for any illegal purpose… what is the purpose of your hundred thousand?" The room is buzzing with noise. Everyone thinks Seldon is trapped. He has no good answer. The Chief Commissioner, Linge Chen, is the only one who stays perfectly still. 
</Person1><Person1> Hari Seldon waits for the room to become quiet. Then, he gives his answer. "To minimize the effects of that destruction." And then he reveals the real, shocking truth. The fall of Trantor is not the whole story. It is just one part of a much bigger problem. He says, "I refer, gentlemen, to the developing decline and fall of the Galactic Empire." 
</Person1><Person1> The room explodes in noise. People are shouting "Treason!" The Advocate is yelling. But Seldon has said it. The secret is out. The Chief Commissioner hits his gavel, a special hammer, and the room becomes silent again. The Advocate asks Seldon if he understands he is talking about an Empire that has lasted for twelve thousand years. Seldon says he understands its history better than anyone in the room. He says the fall is happening because of many small things, happening over centuries. It’s too big to stop now. He ends with a powerful image. He says the Empire is like a huge, old tree. It looks strong on the outside, but inside, it is rotten. And a storm is coming. He says, "Listen with the ears of psychohistory, and you will hear the creaking." 
</Person1><Person1> So, the big secret is out. Seldon is not trying to stop the fall. He knows it's impossible. His project has a different purpose. He wants to make the time after the fall… better. Shorter. But what does that mean? He has told the Commission the Empire will fall, a terrible truth. What will they do to him now? Seldon has a plan to shorten the 30,000 years of darkness that will follow. He wants to create an Encyclopedia Galactica, to save all human knowledge. But to do that, he will have to make a deal with the very men who want to silence him. He will be given a choice: death, or exile to a lonely planet at the edge of the galaxy. We’ll find out what he chooses next time. </Person1>
