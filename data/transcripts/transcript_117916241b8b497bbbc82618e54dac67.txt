Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! I'm so glad you're here with me.
Last time, we felt the tension building. An envoy from the new kingdom of Anacreon, a man named Anselm haut Rodric, arrived on Terminus. Mayor Hardin met him, and we could tell Rodric was not just visiting for fun. He was looking at Terminus with hungry eyes. Now, let's see what happens when this powerful man from a kingdom of warriors meets the quiet leader of the scientists, Dr. Pirenne.
Rodric is curious about the leader of Terminus. He asks Hardin, "And your leader… the man I am to meet?" Hardin explains that the leader is Dr. Pirenne, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees. Rodric seems surprised. "A doctor? A scholar? He is the most important person here?" he asks. It's clear that in his world, soldiers and kings have power, not teachers.
Hardin smiles and answers in a friendly way. He says, “We’re all scholars more or less.” He then says something very clever. He tells Rodric that Terminus is a scientific foundation, under the direct control of the Emperor. Mmm… notice how he says that? He puts a little extra sound on the word direct. This seems to make Rodric feel a bit uncomfortable. The envoy becomes quiet and thoughtful as they walk to the main square.
Later that day, Hardin watches the two leaders together. Pirenne, the scholar, and Rodric, the warrior. And it is… not going well. (soft laugh) They say nice things to each other, but you can feel they do not like each other at all. Pirenne gives Rodric a long tour of the Encyclopedia building. He is very proud. He shows him all the rooms, the films, the books, the departments for editing and publishing.
Picture it. You're walking through huge, quiet rooms filled with information. Pirenne is talking quickly, so excited about all this knowledge. But Rodric just has a polite, empty smile on his face. He is not interested. Finally, after seeing everything, Rodric asks a simple, but powerful question. "This is all very interesting," he says. "But what good is it?"
What good is it? Pirenne has no answer. His face shows his shock and anger. For him, knowledge is the most important thing in the universe. For Rodric, it's useless. This one question shows the huge difference between their two worlds.
That evening, at dinner, the situation is the same, but reversed. Now, Rodric talks. And talks. And talks. He tells everyone about his time as a soldier. He describes, with great excitement, all the details of spaceships being destroyed in a war. He loves talking about fighting. Pirenne and the other scholars just have to listen.
After dinner, the three men—Pirenne, Hardin, and Rodric—go out onto a balcony. The night is warm. The Galaxy is a beautiful, misty shape across the entire sky. It’s a peaceful moment. But the peace doesn't last long.
Rodric leans back and says, "And now, to serious matters."
This is the moment. This is the real reason he is here. He explains that things have changed in this part of the galaxy. The old rules are gone. He says the status of Terminus is… uncertain. He wants to come to an "understanding." Can you guess what that means? It's often a polite word people use when they want to take control.
He talks about the other new kingdoms near Terminus. He warns Pirenne that one of them, Smyrno, could attack Terminus at any time. Pirenne is not worried. He says, "The Emperor would not let that happen!" He keeps repeating that Terminus is part of the Emperor's personal property.
Rodric just blows smoke rings from his cigar. He tells Pirenne that papers with the Emperor's seal don't matter anymore. The Emperor is far away. Anacreon is close. He says Anacreon has a new treaty. This treaty gives them the job of keeping order in this area… for the Emperor, of course.
Hardin finally breaks in. He’s tired of the games. He asks Rodric directly, “What is your proposition?” In other words, what do you really want?
And Rodric tells him. Anacreon must establish a military base on Terminus. You know, to protect it. He says they won’t interfere with how Terminus is run. Hardin makes a small, dry sound. He doesn't believe that for a second.
Then comes the real question. How will Terminus pay for this "protection"? Hardin understands right away. "Now we're getting to the nub," he says. The nub is the central point of a problem. He says, "Terminus is to be a protectorate and to pay tribute."
Let’s look at that word, protectorate. A protectorate is a country that is controlled and defended by a more powerful country. It sounds nice, but it really means the smaller country has lost its freedom. And tribute is the money or goods it must pay for this "protection."
Rodric corrects him. "Not tribute. Taxes."
Pirenne gets very angry. He bangs his hand on his chair. He shouts that Terminus is a tax-free place, supported by the State. But Rodric calmly replies, "But we are the State now. And we're not supporting you." He reminds Pirenne that the King of Anacreon is much, much closer than the Emperor.
Hardin, always practical, asks how they would pay these taxes. Gold? Other valuable metals? Rodric likes that idea. But Hardin just laughs. He takes out a coin and tosses it to Rodric. It’s made of steel. He explains that Terminus has no metals. They import everything. They have no gold to give.
Rodric is confused. A whole planet with no metals? He suggests they could pay with land. He says many nobles on Anacreon would love to have large new estates. Pirenne is horrified. Give away their land? To warriors?
So, the real plan is finally clear. Anacreon wants to take over Terminus, piece by piece. They want its land. Pirenne is stuck in the past, trusting in an Emperor who is too far away to help. Hardin is quiet, watching, thinking. He knows words and old papers won't save them.
Pirenne believes a message from the Emperor's chancellor, Lord Dorwin, will solve everything. But Hardin knows the Empire is weak. He has another plan, a secret. He knows something about technology that he thinks these new kingdoms have forgotten. He is about to make a very risky move, a gamble that will change everything for Terminus. What could his secret be? We’ll find out next time.
