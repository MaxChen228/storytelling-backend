<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Today, we are starting a brand new story, and it begins in a very dark and intense place. We meet a man who wants to die, but he can't control his own body.
</Person1><Person2>That sounds incredibly chilling. So he's trapped?
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. Imagine being a prisoner inside your own mind. You want to do one thing, but something else, something powerful, forces you to do the opposite. This is the reality for our character, Marsh.
</Person1><Person2>And who is Marsh? What does he look like?
</Person2><Person1>He's an Inquisitor, which is a very powerful and frightening figure in this world. And his appearance is... well, it's shocking. He has large steel spikes driven directly through his eyes. They come out the back of his head.
</Person1><Person2>Through his eyes? So he can't see?
</Person2><Person1>Not like we do. But the spikes give him a different kind of sight. He sees the world outlined in thin, blue lines. It's how he senses the room, the other Inquisitors with him, and... the man tied to a table in front of him.
</Person1><Person2>Oh no. So this isn't just about his internal pain, he's about to hurt someone else?
</Person2><Person1>Yes, and this is where his internal fight becomes so clear. For a brief moment, Marsh gets control of himself. The joy he felt from this dark power turns to horror. He realizes the man on the table is a good person, a Keeper of Terris, and killing him is a terrible crime.
</Person1><Person2>Can he stop it? Can he fight back?
</Person2><Person1>He tries. Mmm... he really does. The story says he "struggled." Let's talk about that word. To "struggle" means to try very, very hard to do something difficult. Like when you struggle to lift something heavy. Marsh is struggling against this force inside him. He even tries to pull out the main spike in his back, which would kill him, just to stop what's happening.
</Person1><Person1>But he can't. The force is too strong. The story tells us this entity was once "imprisoned," which means it was locked away in a prison. Now it's free, and its name is Ruin.
</Person1><Person2>Ruin... that's a terrifying name. So Ruin is controlling Marsh completely?
</Person2><Person1>Completely. Marsh's moment of clarity is gone. The horror is replaced by a twisted kind of fun. He picks up a mallet, and the chapter ends with him beginning to pound a new spike into the poor man's chest. It's a very grim start.
</Person1><Person2>It really is. It sets up this villain, Ruin, as something truly awful. What's the main takeaway here?
</Person2><Person1>I think the main point is to show us the terrible power of Ruin. It doesn't just kill people; it takes away their free will and turns them into monsters who enjoy causing pain. It makes you wonder... who could possibly stand up to a power like that?
</Person1><Person2>That's the big question, isn't it? What happens next?
</Person2><Person1>Well, our next chapter introduces a very different kind of character, and a very different kind of prisoner. His name is TenSoon, and he's being held in a dark pit. He has a dangerous secret, a secret so important he was willing to betray his own people for it. And now... he is about to face his judgment.
</Person1><Person2>From one prisoner to another. I can't wait to find out what his secret is.
</Person2><Person1>We'll find out next time. Thank you for joining us!</Person1>
