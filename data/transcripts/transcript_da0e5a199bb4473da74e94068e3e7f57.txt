Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we saw something incredible. Elend used his power to stop an entire army of koloss. He became their leader in a single moment. Today, we will learn the secret of his amazing strength. And we will join another friend, Sazed, who is feeling very, very different.
Let’s start with that secret. Why is Elend so powerful? Well, it’s because of special beads of metal. These beads were found at a place called the Well. They turn people into Mistborn. But they create a very special kind of Mistborn.
The first Mistborn had what we can call… 'primal power'. 'Primal' means original, or the very first. It is pure and very, very strong. Elend has this primal power. The Lord Ruler also had this power. Over many years, this power was passed down from parents to children. But with each new generation, the power became a little weaker. So, Elend is powerful like the ancient Allomancers. It’s a strength we haven't seen in a long, long time.
Now, let's leave that idea and find Sazed. Can you picture him? He is not in a grand castle. He is in a simple guardhouse at the Pits of Hathsin. This is a place with a dark, sad history. Sazed is sitting with a warm mug of tea. Outside the window, the mists are already here. He can see cracks in the dark ground. Years ago, slaves were forced to go into those cracks. They looked for a special metal called atium. If they didn't find enough, they were killed. It was a terrible place.
Sazed thinks about the thousands of people who died there, lost and forgotten in the ground. It makes the warm tea in his hands feel… a little less warm, you know?
Inside the room, Sazed is with the leaders of his people, the Terris elders. They are looking at papers that show how much food and supplies they have. Sazed is trying to help them. He gives them suggestions. He tells them to build more latrines, which are simple toilets. He says, "There may be refugees. I want you to be ready."
But the elders don’t want suggestions. They want a leader. One of them asks, "Will you not reconsider your place with us, Master Keeper? We need a leader."
Sazed shakes his head. He says the Terris people were oppressed for too long. They don't need another king. But they say they need one of their own to guide them. Sazed looks at them and says quietly, "The Lord Ruler was one of our own." And the room becomes silent. Everyone feels the shame of that truth.
Sazed feels he is not the right person to lead. He tells them, "I was the lowest of the Keepers. A rebel and a reject." One of the elders then notices something. He says, "You do not wear your copperminds." These are the metal bracers that Keepers always wear. They are a part of who he is. But Sazed has put them in his pack. It’s like he is trying to put away his own identity. He feels he cannot be the man they need him to be.
This brings us to our language spotlight. Sazed was having 'melancholy' thoughts. Melancholy. That means a deep, quiet sadness that lasts for a long time. It’s not just being sad for a moment. It’s a heavy feeling that stays with you. Sazed is full of this melancholy.
But even with this sadness, Sazed is still a scholar. He is still a Keeper. He asks the elders a question. "Have any of your people died in… odd circumstances? From the mists?"
One of the men laughs a little. He says the mists are not dangerous. He says, "Of course we send our people out to work in them during the day."
This is a huge clue! Remember? The mists have been killing people who go out in the daytime. But… not the Terris people. Why? What is the connection? Sazed feels too tired to think about it. He feels… apathetic. That means he doesn't have the energy to care about anything. He just wants to hide.
But a small spark inside him, a little piece of the old Sazed, refuses to give up. He knows he must keep moving. He must keep working for Elend and Vin. So he tells the elders, "I'm sorry. I must leave."
So, Sazed is leaving the Pits of Hathsin. He has refused to be a leader, but he has found a very important clue about the mists. He is lost in his own sadness, but he is still moving forward.
Next time, our story will shift again. We will join Spook, who is hurt and sick. In his fever, he will remember his childhood. We will learn about his first name, Lestibournes, and the painful reason he chose a name that means, 'I have been abandoned'.
