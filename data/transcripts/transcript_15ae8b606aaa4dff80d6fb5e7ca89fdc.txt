<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we felt a terrifying power take control of Marsh. It used his body to find something hidden. Now, we leave that dark scene and meet someone new. Someone who knows a different kind of power… and a different kind of prison.
</Person1><Person1>Let’s begin in a place with no light. Imagine complete darkness. This is how TenSoon’s day always starts. You see, he doesn’t have any eyes. He is a kandra, a very special kind of creature. He is old, and he knows how to make eyes. But without a skeleton, without bones, eyes are useless. His body is just… a soft mass of muscle. If he moved the wrong way, he would crush them. Can you picture that? A body made of something like soft, wet clay.
</Person1><Person1>His body is very interesting. The book says it is like a mass of large snails, all connected. This body is malleable. Mmm, that’s a great word. Malleable means something can be easily changed into a new shape. Think of a piece of soft dough for making bread. You can push it and pull it to make any shape you want. TenSoon’s body is like that. He can change his shape. But without bones to build on, he is impotent. That means he is powerless. He has no strength.
</Person1><Person1>So, TenSoon is a shapeshifter, but he is trapped. He is in a small stone pit, like a deep hole in the floor. A metal grate covers the top. It’s his prison cell. He is stuck in this small space, smelling his own waste. It’s a terrible place. But he has a special ability called the Blessing of Presence. It means his mind is very strong. He will not go mad, or crazy, from the stress. But sometimes… sometimes he wishes he could go mad. It would be easier than feeling this pain every day.
</Person1><Person1>So, we meet TenSoon in a dark, lonely pit. He is a creature who can become anything, but right now, he is nothing. He is trapped and powerless, with only his strong mind to keep him company. What a sad way to live, right?
</Person1><Person1>Now, let's think about why he is here. TenSoon is a Contract-breaker. A contract is a serious promise. For the kandra, the Contract is their most important law. And TenSoon broke it. He helped someone who was not his master. This caused his master to die. That is a very serious crime. The punishment should be death. But his crime is even worse than that. You see, TenSoon betrayed his people’s biggest secret. He told someone something he should not have. This secret is so important that his people are terrified. They think he has doomed them all. They could become slaves again because of what he did.
</Person1><Person1>It’s strange, isn’t it? He knows he did something terrible. He knows he deserves to die. But deep inside, he still feels he did the right thing. He is confused. He feels both guilt and… rightness. It’s a heavy weight to carry in that dark pit. He is waiting for his punishment, but he still wants to live. It makes you wonder… what was the secret? And why was helping someone else the right thing to do, even if it broke all the rules?
</Person1><Person1>So, TenSoon is a criminal. He broke his people's most important rules and shared their most important secret. He believes he deserves death, but he also believes he was right. A very difficult situation.
</Person1><Person1>Suddenly, something changes. He feels vibrations. Someone is coming! He prepares for food. But it’s not food. He feels the heavy grate above him being dragged open. Then, sharp hooks grab his soft body! They pull him out of the pit. It is very painful. He is thrown onto the dirty floor. He can taste the old, dry food on the ground. And then he smells it. A sharp, terrible smell. Acid. They are going to kill him.
</Person1><Person1>But wait! Something hard falls onto him. He touches it with his muscles. He tastes it. It’s a skull. A human skull! The kandra law, the First Contract, says they must give him a chance to speak before they kill him. To speak, he needs a body. The skull is his chance. The smell of acid gets stronger. He has to be fast! He works with desperation. Desperation is a feeling of great fear and hurry. It’s when you know something bad is happening, and you must do something right now. He pushes his muscle into the skull. He uses stored flesh to make skin, a tongue, lungs. He is building a face, a voice, from nothing.
</Person1><Person1>And just as he works, the acid hits him! It burns his body, dissolving his muscles. The guards are following the rule, but they don’t want him to actually speak. They are pouring the acid to kill him quickly. But TenSoon is faster than they think. He forms a throat, he breathes in, and he shouts one word.
</Person1><Person1>“Judgment!”
</Person1><Person1>The pouring stops. The burning continues, but the acid stops. He did it. He stopped them. He has demanded a trial. A voice whispers to him, telling him to accept death quietly. A trial will be public. Everyone will know his secret. His punishment will be worse than death. It will be an eternity of pain. But TenSoon whispers the word again. “Judgment.” He has made his choice. He will not die quietly in the dark. He will face everyone.
</Person1><Person1>So, in a moment of pure desperation, TenSoon builds just enough of a body to speak. He uses his last chance not to beg for his life, but to demand a public trial, a judgment. He knows this choice will bring him more pain, not freedom. It’s a powerful and puzzling decision.
</Person1><Person1>And that is where we leave him. TenSoon has chosen a public trial, even though it seems like the worst possible choice. He will stand before all the kandra generations. He will be accused of terrible crimes, like killing another kandra and breaking his Contract. But TenSoon has a plan. He is ready to reveal the true nature of his actions… and the real reason the kandra must serve humans. I cannot wait to see what happens next. Join me next time as we enter the courtroom and hear TenSoon’s defense. Goodbye for now!</Person1>
