Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Salvor Hardin as a prisoner of the angry Prince Regent Wienis. But Hardin was not afraid. He revealed his master plan: at midnight, a religious command called an 'interdict' would shut down the entire planet of Anacreon. Now, the clock is ticking, and midnight is almost here.
Wienis, suddenly furious, rushes out of the room. Let's picture the scene he runs into. It's a huge ballroom, filled with important people. But right now, it is completely silent. A hush had fallen over everyone. They are all watching the young king, Lepold, sitting on his throne. The big lights, the chandeliers, are dim. Only tiny, multi-colored lights shine down from the high ceiling, making everything look magical. The king looks very powerful, with a special royal light, an aura, shining above his head like a crown.
Wienis pauses on the stairway. No one sees him. He clenches his fists. This means he makes his hands into tight balls, showing he is very angry or stressed. He thinks Hardin is just bluffing, just trying to trick him. He decides to wait. And then… something impossible begins to happen. The throne… it starts to lift up from the floor. Noiselessly, it floats into the air. It moves slowly down the steps and drifts across the room, just a few centimeters above the carpet, heading toward a large, open window.
Then, a deep bell rings out. Bong. It is exactly midnight. At the sound of the bell, the floating throne stops. And in that same moment, the king's shining aura… disappears. It's just gone. For a frozen second, the king's face is twisted in surprise. He looks like a normal, human man, not a king. And then, CRASH! The throne wobbles and drops to the floor with a loud thump. At the exact same time, every single light in the palace goes out. It is complete, shocking darkness.
Mmm… before we find out what happens in the chaos, let's talk about that useful phrase: 'a hush had fallen'. A hush is a deep, sudden quiet. So when we say a hush had fallen, it means a noisy place became silent very quickly. Everyone stopped talking at once, usually because something surprising or very serious happened. It’s a great way to describe a dramatic moment, just like in that ballroom.
In the darkness, people are shrieking, confused and scared. We hear Wienis’s powerful voice bull-shouting, 'Get the flares! Get the flares!' Flares are special torches that make a very bright light. He pushes his way through the frightened crowd. Soon, palace guards arrive with flares, filling the dark room with strange blue, green, and red light. And then a captain gives Wienis the terrible news. The palace is surrounded by the people of the city. A huge, angry mob. And who is their leader? A priest. He says the people demand two things: free Mayor Salvor Hardin, and stop the war against the Foundation.
Wienis is furious. He rushes back to the room where Hardin is being held. He finds Hardin sitting calmly, with a small, ironic smile on his face. Wienis shouts, 'Order your priests back to their jobs!' But Hardin just looks at him coolly. He explains that right now, nothing on Anacreon is working. There are no lights. There is no water. There is no heat. The hospitals are closed. The power plants are shut down. All ships are grounded. The entire planet has been stopped by the priests. 'If you don't like it,' Hardin says, 'you can order them back to work.'
Wienis still believes he can win. He shouts that his army can fight the priests. But Hardin explains that all communication is also shut down. Wienis can't give any orders. Wienis plays his last card. He says, 'You can't stop my fleet! They are on their way to the Foundation right now! When they win, your people will see their religion is nothing!' His voice croaks with excitement. But Hardin just replies lightly. He says, yes, it's the ship he ordered repaired… but he repaired it in his own special way. He asks Wienis if he's ever heard of a 'hyperwave relay'. As he speaks, the televisor screen in the room suddenly flashes to life.
Now, the story jumps far away, into space. We are on the most powerful ship in the fleet, the flagship Wienis. A high-ranking priest named Theo Aporat is on board. He feels heartsick, which means he is full of sadness and regret. He helped repair this wonderful ship, and now it is being used for sacrilege. Sacrilege is a powerful word. It means an act of great disrespect towards something holy or religious. Aporat knows the plan to attack the Foundation is a terrible sin. The ship's commander, Prince Lefkin, tells him to mind his own business. But Aporat has a plan. He goes to the general communications room. The clock shows five minutes to twelve.
With practiced hands, he turns on the communications system. Now, his voice and his image can be seen and heard in every part of the two-mile-long ship. He speaks to all the soldiers. 'Your ship,' he cries, 'is engaged in sacrilege!' He tells them that their mission will doom their souls. He says that in the name of the Galactic Spirit, he is removing their commander from his command. Because no one, not even a king, can rule without the Spirit's blessing.
So you see, Hardin's plan was bigger than anyone knew. It wasn't just about turning off the lights on one planet. It was about using the people's faith as the ultimate weapon. Wienis thought power came from ships and guns. Hardin knew that true control came from what people believe. He has turned Anacreon's own religion against its rulers, both on the ground and now, in the stars.
Aporat has just declared the mission a sin against the Galactic Spirit. What will the thousands of soldiers on the ship do? Will they follow their prince, or will they follow their priest? In our next chapter, we will see the great ship plunge into darkness and silence, just like the palace. Aporat will seize control and force the prince to send a message back to Wienis—an ultimatum that will decide the fate of everyone. Join me next time to hear what that message says. Goodbye for now.
