<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time we were together, we left Hober Mallow in an absolutely impossible situation. His ship, the Far Star, was surrounded by a furious mob on the planet Korell, all because a Foundation missionary had illegally boarded. Mallow had just put down a near-mutiny from his own crew, asserting his total authority in the face of chaos. The air was thick with tension, and a single wrong move could mean destruction.
</Person1><Person1>The chapter opens right in that heart-pounding moment. Mallow turns away from his crew and confronts the missionary, Revered Parma. And his first words are just ice cold. "Did you know," he asks, "that, by convention, no Foundation missionaries may enter the Korellian territory?" He's not asking for information; he's stating a fact. A verdict.
</Person1><Person1>The missionary, Jord Parma, is trembling. He appeals to a higher power, to the Galactic Spirit, saying he must go where the Spirit leads him. He talks about enlightenment and higher laws. But Mallow just cuts right through it. "That's outside the question," he says. "You are here against the law... I cannot in law protect you." Mmm... the finality in those words. It's chilling.
</Person1><Person1>And as he says this, you can hear the sounds from outside the ship. The author uses these wonderful, vivid phrases here: the "raucous clamor" of the ship's communication system and the "faint, undulating gabble" of the angry crowd. Let's pause on that for a moment. 'Raucous' means a loud, harsh, unpleasant sound. And 'undulating gabble'… well, 'undulating' means moving in a wave-like motion, up and down, and 'gabble' is just fast, meaningless talk. So you can just picture it, can't you? Not a clear chant, but this terrifying, rising and falling wave of angry noise. It makes the threat feel so much more real, so much more chaotic.
</Person1><Person1>The sound makes the missionary's eyes wild with fear. He pleads with Mallow, asking, "Have you not guns? Have you not a ship?" But just then, Lieutenant Tinter returns. The mob has made its demand: they want Jord Parma. And if not? Well, Tinter says they're making all sorts of threats. They seem completely mad.
</Person1><Person1>And then Mallow makes his decision. A decision that I think shocks everyone on that ship, and probably us as readers, too. He tells Tinter to send a message back: if the local governor approaches the ship alone, he can have the missionary. Just like that. And to make sure no one interferes… he pulls out a gun. A gun. On his own ship. He points it directly at Jaim Twer, the man who argued for honor, for protecting the missionary. He says, "I don't know what insubordination is... but if there's anyone here who thinks he can teach me, I'd like to teach him my antidote in return." The threat is so clear, so absolute. Twer backs down, his face twisted in defeat.
</Person1><Person1>You can just imagine the silence on the bridge as they watch a single, tiny figure detach from the crowd and walk hesitantly toward the ship. The missionary screeches curses as he's dragged out, pleading to a deaf heaven. And then… it's over. Mallow puts his blaster away and calmly orders his men back to their stations.
</Person1><Person1>But the real story, the real genius of Hober Mallow, comes next. He takes Twer to his private quarters. And instead of punishing him further, he explains. He stares Twer down, and the book says he does it "sardonically." That's another great word. It means he's being mocking, cynical, as if Twer's idealism is something childish to be laughed at. Mallow tells him, "Frankly, the incident smelled too bad."
</Person1><Person1>And here is the twist. Mallow lays it all out. Think about it, he says. A missionary suddenly appears in a remote spaceport. An entire mob gathers from a city a hundred miles away in just half an hour. How is that possible? It isn't. It was a setup. A trap. A test. The Korellians wanted to see if the Foundation trader was a religious fanatic who would start a war over a single missionary. By handing Parma over, by choosing cold logic over heroic gallantry, Mallow proved he wasn't. He proved he was a trader, not a crusader.
</Person1><Person1>And right on cue, a message arrives. It’s an invitation from the leader of Korell, Commdor Asper. The invitation Mallow had been waiting a week for. He tosses the message to Twer and says, "I think we passed a test." It's just brilliant, ruthless strategy.
</Person1><Person1>So, Mallow finally gets his meeting. And the Commdor is… quite a character. He presents himself as a simple "man of the people," with messy hair and a dirty shirt. He talks endlessly about Peace, calling himself "Asper, the Well-Beloved." But Mallow, ever observant, notices the heavily armed guards hiding in the garden and the newly reinforced steel walls around the palace. It's all a performance. The Commdor's folksy charm is just as much a trap as the missionary was.
</Person1><Person1>Mallow plays along perfectly, flattering the Commdor, talking about their shared "republican blessings." And then, smoothly, he pivots to the real reason he's there: trade. He speaks of mutual benefit, of prosperity, of everything an enlightened ruler who is a "friend of the people" would surely want for his citizens.
</Person1><Person1>So Mallow has navigated the deadly trap and is now face-to-face with the man who set it. He’s proven he’s a pragmatist, not a zealot. But what can he possibly offer a world that is so deeply suspicious of the Foundation? Well, next time, we’ll see Mallow unveil his true sales pitch. It’s a strategy that has nothing to do with faith, and everything to do with human desire and immense, immense profit. It's a masterful move, and you won't want to miss it.
</Person1><Person1>That's all for our discussion today. Thank you for listening, and I look forward to exploring the next chapter with you soon. Goodbye for now.</Person1>
