<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left Spook on a burning roof. He had new, strange powers from a ghost… the ghost of Kelsier. Today, we leave that fiery city. We travel deep, deep underground to a place called the Homeland.
</Person1><Person1>Our story begins with the mists. You remember the mists that cover the world. Some people feel something strange in them. They feel a kind of… hatred. It feels alive. The word for this is sentient. Sentient means something can think and feel, like a person. But for most people, the mists are just like bad weather. Nothing more.
</Person1><Person1>Now… let’s go to our new character. Imagine a very large cave, deep under the earth. The walls glow with a soft, green light from special moss. In the center of this huge cave, there is a cage. An iron cage. And inside, a kandra named TenSoon sits on the cold floor.
</Person1><Person1>He is there because he broke the rules. But for the kandra, this cage is a great insult. A kandra would not run away. He came to be punished. But still, they lock him up. The leaders want everyone to see him. They want his name to be a byword of shame. That’s when a name is used to mean something very, very bad. They want other kandra to hear the name 'TenSoon' and think of a traitor.
</Person1><Person1>TenSoon feels angry. He tried to warn his people. He told them about the danger in the world above. He told them about the gods, Ruin and Preservation, who are at war. But they did not listen. Now, he just sits, and he watches. He sees young kandra learning to use their bodies. He sees others preparing food. And he thinks about the eternity he will spend alone in a stone pit.
</Person1><Person1>Many kandra come to look at him. Some older ones spit on the ground. They show they are loyal to the leaders. Some who are his friends come to look with sadness. And the youngest kandra come because they are curious. They want to see the famous TenSoon in his cage.
</Person1><Person1>Then, he sees a familiar face. It is a kandra named MeLaan. He feels ashamed and turns away. He doesn't want her to see him like this. But she comes closer to the cage. "TenSoon?" she whispers. He tells her to go away. But she doesn't listen.
</Person1><Person1>“They shouldn’t be able to do this to you,” she says. Her voice is full of anger. She tells him he is wise, and he should not be in a cage. TenSoon disagrees. He says the leaders are chosen. They must be followed. This is the kandra way. This is order.
</Person1><Person1>But MeLaan is not happy. "After what is happening above?" she asks. She tells him that everything he warned them about is true. The world is covered in black ash. The mists are killing people during the day. Armies are marching to war. She says, "Ruin has returned."
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… this is a difficult moment for TenSoon. He believes in order. He believes in tradition. But he also knows the world is in danger. MeLaan tells him that many of the younger kandra would fight. They would follow him. They need a leader. But TenSoon knows the leaders are watching. They are listening to everything. It is a test.
</Person1><Person1>MeLaan then asks a secret question. She asks about a special power, the Blessing of Potency. TenSoon had it, but the leaders did not find it. She asks if she can get it for him, so he can fight. But TenSoon says no. "I will not fight my own people," he says. "I am kandra."
</Person1><Person1>He sends her away, but a seed of a new idea is planted. He chose to accept his punishment. But what if that is not the only way to help his people? MeLaan thinks he has given up. She thinks he just came back to die. But TenSoon has a secret. He asks her a quiet question about some old dog bones he used to wear. Why is he asking about these bones if he plans to stay in his cage forever? What is he truly thinking?
</Person1><Person1>We will have to see what choice he makes. Thank you for listening to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide. I hope to see you next time.</Person1>
