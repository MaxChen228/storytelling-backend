<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Today, we are starting a new story. It begins in a dark place, with a man who is not who he seems. Let’s begin.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine a man named Marsh. He wants to die. He is trying to kill himself, but he can't. His hand is shaking. He wants to reach for a metal spike in his back. If he pulls it out, he will die. But he cannot make his body move. He is trapped.
</Person1><Person1>For three years, he has been a prisoner inside his own mind. Mmm… can you imagine that? Three whole years. He knows there is no escape. He has given up trying to be free. His mind feels… cloudy, you know? Like a foggy day when you cannot see clearly.
</Person1><Person1>And then, something changes. A force, something he calls ‘It’, takes control of his body. Suddenly, the world feels different. It feels right. He is not worried anymore. He is not struggling. Everything is okay. But… is it really okay?
</Person1><Person1>Let’s look at what Marsh sees. He steps forward. He cannot see like you and I. He has long, steel spikes in his eyes. The spikes go all the way through his head. If he touches the back of his head, he can feel the sharp points. There is no blood, just the cold metal. It’s a terrible picture, isn't it?
</Person1><Person1>But these spikes give him a special kind of sight. He sees the world in thin, blue lines. These lines show him everything. They show him the room, the tables, and the other people with him. These other people are like him. They also have spikes through their eyes. They are all Inquisitors.
</Person1><Person1>An Inquisitor. That's our first important word today. An Inquisitor in this story is a very powerful and frightening person. They serve a dark master. And their spikes… well, the spikes give them power, but they also take something away. So, Marsh is an Inquisitor. A powerful servant of darkness.
</Person1><Person1>Everyone in the room is an Inquisitor, except for one person. There is a man tied to a table. He is the prisoner. Marsh looks at him and smiles. He picks up a new spike from another table. It's heavy in his hand. The prisoner is not wearing a gag, which is something you put over someone's mouth to keep them quiet. They want to hear him scream.
</Person1><Person1>The prisoner is whispering. “Please,” he says. He is shaking with fear. He is a good man, a Terrisman, but even he is terrified. He is tied to the table in a strange way. There is another body under him. The table was made for this… this horrible purpose.
</Person1><Person1>The prisoner asks, “What is it you want?” He thinks they want information. But Marsh is not interested in information. He just holds the spike, feeling its sharp point. He is enjoying the man’s fear. He waits… he wants to enjoy it, but then… something happens.
</Person1><Person1>The real Marsh, the man inside, takes control for just a moment! Suddenly, the room doesn't smell sweet. It smells of blood and death. The joy he felt turns to horror. He sees the prisoner for who he is: a Keeper of Terris. A good man who has helped people his whole life. To kill him would be a tragedy. A tragedy is a very, very sad event.
</Person1><Person1>So Marsh struggles. This is our second word. To struggle means to try very hard to do something that is difficult. Think about trying to lift something very heavy. You have to struggle to lift it. Marsh is struggling against the power inside him. He tries to force his own arm to move, to pull the spike from his back and end his life. He is fighting for control.
</Person1><Person1>But the other force, ‘It’, is too strong. Marsh cannot win. This force needs Marsh. It needs the Inquisitors to be its hands in the world. This power is free now, but it is not complete. It is fighting against something else, something that protects the land like a shield. This evil force needs something more. Something hidden.
</Person1><Person1>And Marsh must find it for his master. The master that a woman named Vin set free. This master, this terrible thing, was a prisoner in a place called the Well of Ascension. And it has a name. It calls itself… Ruin.
</Person1><Person1>The control is lost. The real Marsh is gone again. Now, it is only the Inquisitor. He smiles as the prisoner starts to cry. He steps forward and raises the heavy spike. He places the sharp point against the man’s chest. The spike has to go through the prisoner’s heart… and into the body of the Inquisitor tied underneath him. It’s a messy, terrible art.
</Person1><Person1>And the Inquisitor thinks… it is so much fun. He picks up a hammer. And he begins to pound.
</Person1><Person1>So, that is where we begin. With a man who is both a monster and a victim. Marsh is a prisoner in his own body, forced to do terrible things by this power called Ruin. It’s a dark start, isn’t it? It shows us that sometimes, the biggest fight is the one inside your own mind.
</Person1><Person1>But Marsh is not the only one who is a prisoner. In our next chapter, we will go to a very different place. A deep, dark pit. There, we will meet someone named TenSoon. He is not human. And he is trapped, waiting for his end. But he is about to make a desperate choice. A choice that will stop his own death… and start something much, much bigger. What will he do? We will find out next time.</Person1>
