"Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings!
Last time, we journeyed through the incredible genesis of Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. We saw how a young Asimov, inspired by Gibbon, conceived of a Galactic Empire's fall and the revolutionary idea of psychohistory. We followed the saga from its initial publication, through its unexpected triumph with a special Hugo Award, and the persistent, almost relentless demands from readers and editors for him to 'finish' what he thought was already complete.  
We left off with Asimov, after much reluctance, finally accepting that staggering fifty-thousand-dollar advance to revisit his beloved universe, a universe he hadn't touched in thirty years. He reread the original trilogy, feeling a little uneasy about its lack of physical action, but ultimately found renewed vigor to write, incorporating modern scientific concepts and aiming for a unified, longer narrative. And now, the fruits of that labor, the story itself, begins! 
Today, we're stepping into the pages of Foundation proper, right at the very beginning of 'Part One: The Psychohistorians,' and chapter 'i.' The very first words we encounter are a fascinating, almost encyclopedic entry about the legendary figure, Hari Seldon. We're given his birth and death dates, not just in the Galactic Era, but also translated into the Foundational Era—a subtle hint, perhaps, of the shift in historical perspective that Seldon himself will usher in. 
He's described as being born to middle-class parents on a world called Flelicon, in the Arcturus sector. And there's this wonderful, almost whimsical detail about his father possibly being a tobacco grower in hydroponic plants. (soft laugh) It's a legend, the text says, of 'doubtful authenticity,' which I find so charming. It grounds this futuristic, grand narrative in something relatable, doesn't it? Even in a galactic empire, there are family legends, a touch of folklore. 
But what's undeniable is Seldon's 'amazing ability in mathematics' from an early age. The anecdotes about his genius are 'innumerable,' though some are 'contradictory.' It paints a picture of a figure so impactful, so almost mythical, that his early life is already shrouded in a mix of fact and legend. 
And then, the pivotal statement: 'Undoubtedly his greatest contributions were in the field of psychohistory.' Seldon, we're told, found this field as 'little more than a set of vague axioms,' but he transformed it, left it a profound statistical science. This is where the true heart of Foundation lies, this revolutionary science that predicts the future of vast populations. 
We also learn that our best source for Seldon's life details is a biography written by Gaal Dornick, a young man who met Seldon just two years before his death. And this, my friends, is our segue! Because the very next section introduces us to Gaal Dornick himself, a 'country boy' who has never seen Trantor in real life. 
Can you imagine that? To live in a galaxy with nearly twenty-five million inhabited planets, all owing allegiance to the grand Galactic Empire, yet to have only seen its majestic capital, Trantor, on hyper-video? It makes you pause, doesn't it? To think of this vast, interconnected civilization, yet for individuals to still have such localized experiences. The text reminds us that at this time, 'no place in the Galaxy was' cut off from civilization, which, uh, is a pretty profound statement about the reach of this Empire. 
Gaal's journey to Trantor is the 'undoubted climax of his young, scholarly life.' He's traveled before, but only to Synnax's satellite for his dissertation on 'meteor driftage mechanics.' But this trip, this journey to the heart of the Empire, to meet Hari Seldon, is something else entirely. 
He's 'steeled himself' for the Jump through hyper-space. Now, this is a fantastic concept that's central to so much science fiction, and Asimov describes it beautifully here. Ordinary space travel, he explains, is limited by the speed of light, meaning years between even the nearest systems. But hyper-space? It's an 'unimaginable region that was neither space nor time, matter nor energy, something nor nothing.' Through it, one can 'traverse the length of the Galaxy in the interval between two neighboring instants of time.' 
It's such a vivid, almost poetic description of something so utterly alien. And Gaal's experience of it? After all that anticipation, that 'little dread curled gently in his stomach,' it's nothing more than a 'trifling jar, a little internal kick which ceased an instant before he could be sure he had felt it.' (soft laugh) Isn't that just classic? The immense build-up, and then the reality is almost anticlimactic in its subtlety. 
After the jump, he's left with the 'large and glistening' ship, a product of '12,000 years of Imperial progress,' and himself, a fresh mathematics doctorate in hand, and that coveted invitation from Hari Seldon. 
His next great anticipation is the first sight of Trantor. He 'haunted the View-room,' watching the incredible hazy swarm of a star cluster, like 'fire-flies caught in mid-motion.' He sees a cold, blue-white gaseous nebula, 'spreading over the window like distant milk.' It's truly a cosmic journey, isn't it? 
But as they approach Trantor, the stars thicken, and Trantor's sun, initially a 'hard, white speck,' begins to dominate. Then, an officer announces the view-room will close. Gaal, in his boyish enthusiasm, tries to plead, 'Would it be possible to let me stay? I would like to see Trantor.' 
The officer, with a smile, explains that they're 'spinning down, sunside,' and Gaal wouldn't want to be 'blinded, burnt, and radiation-scarred.' Ouch. A rather blunt reality check for our eager scholar. Gaal flushes, realizing his provincial accent, a subtle reminder that even in a vast Empire, local identities persist. The officer, trying to soften the blow, dismisses Trantor from space as 'only a gray blur anyway,' suggesting a space-tour later. 
Gaal, despite his polite 'Thank you very much,' feels that lump in his throat. It's 'childish to feel disappointed,' the narrator tells us, but 'childishness comes almost as naturally to a man as to a child.' It's a beautiful, empathetic observation, isn't it? 
The ship finally lands amidst a 'medley of noises'—the hiss of atmosphere, the drone of conditioners, the rumble of engines. Gaal feels the 'slight jar' of independent motion ceasing. He goes through debarkation, his minor baggage quickly inspected. But he's oblivious to it all, lost in the sheer reality of Trantor. 
The air feels thicker, the gravity a bit greater than on Synnax. He wonders if he'll get used to the 'immensity.' And then we get this incredible description of the Debarkation Building itself: 'tremendous,' its roof 'almost lost in the heights,' Gaal imagining 'clouds could form beneath its immensity.' He can see no opposite wall, just a haze where it should be. It's a powerful image, isn't it? It conveys this sense of being utterly dwarfed, swallowed by the scale of this artificial world. 
The annoyed man at the desk eventually tells him to 'Move on, Dornick,' jerking a thumb towards 'Taxis to the right and third left.' Gaal sees 'glowing twists of air suspended high in nothingness' reading 'TAXIS TO ALL POINTS.' 
So, what have we discovered in this foundational chapter? Well, we've been introduced to Hari Seldon, the brilliant mathematician who forged 'psychohistory'—a statistical science that can predict the sweep of future events for vast populations. It's a concept that will underpin the entire saga, offering a scientific, almost mathematical, approach to destiny. We've also met Gaal Dornick, our young, eager protagonist, whose journey to Trantor serves as our eyes and ears into this future. 
And we've experienced his overwhelming first impressions of Trantor—the sheer scale of the Empire, the wonder of hyper-space travel, and the almost crushing immensity of the capital world, even before he's truly stepped out into it. It's a world built on a grand, almost incomprehensible scale. 
For our 'Language Spotlight' today, I really want us to focus on two key terms that are fundamental to understanding this universe. First, "psychohistory." It's not just history, is it? It's a predictive science, a way to map the future of society with mathematical precision. Think of it as a kind of 'social physics' for civilizations. 
And then, "hyper-space." This isn't just faster-than-light travel; Asimov's description is so evocative: 'that unimaginable region that was neither space nor time, matter nor energy, something nor nothing.' It’s the ultimate shortcut, the fabric that allows an empire of twenty-five million inhabited planets to exist as a cohesive whole. Without it, the galaxy would be a collection of isolated islands. 
Gaal's journey has just begun, and what a beginning! He's a small-town boy suddenly thrust into the heart of a galactic civilization, and the scale of it all is almost too much to process. It makes you wonder, doesn't it, how one person navigates such an overwhelming environment? 
Next time, our journey with Gaal Dornick continues. He'll be navigating Trantor's complex, automated transport system, still struggling to find his footing, to find a hotel. We're promised a glimpse of an enclosed flight through tunnels, with a complete absence of sky! And he'll seek out an observation tower, hoping to see the 'open air' of this planet-wide city, only to be met with a breathtaking panorama of endless man-made structures stretching to a uniform gray sky, no ground, no green, no natural life. It's a colossal achievement, yes, but one that harbors a critical vulnerability. What secrets does this vast, artificial world truly hold?
