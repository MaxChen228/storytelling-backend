<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left our kandra friend, TenSoon, in a very dark place. Remember? He was in a pit, about to be dissolved by acid. But with his last bit of strength, he formed a body around a skull and shouted for "Judgment!" He stopped his own execution. Now, he must face a trial in front of his entire people. Let's see what happens.
</Person1><Person1> Picture a large, quiet cavern deep underground. This is the Trustwarren, the home of the kandra. Hundreds of kandra are sitting silently, watching. They don't make noise like humans. They are very still. Their bodies are built on bones of wood, stone, and even metal. At the front, a kandra named KanPaar stands at a tall desk. His bones are made of sparkling red crystal. They shine in the lamplight. He looks down at TenSoon, who is standing alone on a platform. TenSoon feels cold. He has a body now, but no clothes.
</Person1><Person1> KanPaar leans forward. His voice is sharp. "All right, then, TenSoon," he says. He calls TenSoon a traitor to the kandra people. "You have demanded this judgment. Make your plea." A plea is when you ask for something, or explain your actions. TenSoon takes a deep breath. Mmm… it feels so good to breathe again after being just a pile of muscle for so long. He opens his mouth to speak. But KanPaar continues, sneering. That means he is smiling in a very unkind way. He asks, "Explain... why you killed one of our own. A fellow kandra."
</Person1><Person1> TenSoon freezes. This is not the question he expected. He thought they would ask about the big secret he shared. The room is completely silent. Everyone is waiting for his answer. "Yes, I killed a kandra," TenSoon says. His voice is steady. "That is not forbidden." KanPaar points a finger at him. "Need it be forbidden?" he asks loudly. He says that humans and koloss kill each other, but kandra are different. "We don't kill one another!" he shouts.
</Person1><Person1> This is very strange. TenSoon thinks, "Why is he asking this? My betrayal of all our people is surely a greater sin." A sin is a very bad action. TenSoon believes he did something much worse than killing one kandra. But he answers the question. "I was compelled by my Contract," he says simply. This word, Contract, is very important for the kandra. A contract is a set of rules or a very serious promise that you must follow. The kandra have one big law, called the First Contract. And then they have smaller contracts for their jobs.
</Person1><Person1> TenSoon continues his explanation. He reminds KanPaar that KanPaar himself gave him the job. He had a contract with a bad man named Straff Venture. And Straff gave him to his son, Zane. Zane was even worse. "It was Zane who commanded that I kill the kandra OreSeur," TenSoon explains. He had to kill OreSeur so he could take his place and spy on the woman, Vin. When he says Vin's name, some of the kandra whisper. They know her. She is the one who killed their god, the Lord Ruler.
</Person1><Person1> KanPaar's voice gets louder. "And so you did what this Zane commanded? You murdered a member of your own generation!" TenSoon feels a flash of anger. "You think I enjoyed it?" he asks. "OreSeur was my generation brother! I knew him for seven hundred years! But… the Contract…" He can't finish the sentence. He had to follow the rules. "The Contract forbids killing," KanPaar says. "It forbids the killing of men." Then another kandra adds, "And is not a kandra life worth more than that of a man?"
</Person1><Person1> "The words are specific, KanPaar," TenSoon snaps back. He is getting frustrated. "I know them well—I helped write them!" He reminds them that the service contracts, the ones for jobs, only say they cannot kill humans. They say nothing about killing other kandra. KanPaar leans forward again. "Did you argue with Zane? Did you try to get out of it?" TenSoon shakes his head. "I do not argue with my masters," he says. And he didn't want to teach a dangerous man like Zane how to kill a kandra. That would be a terrible idea.
</Person1><Person1> So KanPaar says, "You simply killed OreSeur. And then you took his place." Another leader speaks up. "This is the first time a kandra has been used to imitate another kandra. It is a disturbing precedent you set." A precedent is an action that can be used as an example for future actions. They are worried that now, masters will use kandra to kill other kandra. TenSoon thinks to himself that it was actually a brilliant plan. Vin never knew he wasn't OreSeur. But he hates Zane for making him do it.
</Person1><Person1> "You should have refused," KanPaar says. The other leaders agree. "You betrayed us all with your rashness," one says. Rashness means doing something too quickly, without thinking. And suddenly, TenSoon understands their plan. Ah. They want to show everyone that he is a traitor. If people believe he is a traitor, they won't believe anything else he says later. KanPaar is trying to make him look bad from the very beginning. TenSoon smiles a little. He is an old and clever kandra. It's time to act like it.
</Person1><Person1> "I betrayed us with my rashness?" TenSoon asks, his voice calm. "What of you, glorious Seconds?" The leaders are from the Second Generation of kandra. TenSoon is from the Third. He looks right at them. "Who was it who allowed a Contract to be assigned to Kelsier himself? You gave a kandra servant to the very man who was planning to kill the Father!" KanPaar looks shocked, as if TenSoon slapped him. The other leaders start to defend themselves. "How were we to know?" one sputters. But KanPaar quickly stops him. It is not good for the leaders to look weak.
</Person1><Person1> "You shall speak no more of this," KanPaar orders TenSoon. He says this is not a trial. TenSoon has already admitted he is guilty. This is a judgment. A judgment is when a decision is made about punishment. "Explain your actions," KanPaar says, "then let the First Generation pronounce your fate!" The First Generation are the oldest and most respected kandra. They will decide what happens to TenSoon. TenSoon becomes quiet. He knows it is not time to push them. Not yet.
</Person1><Person1> KanPaar thinks he has won. He asks, "Need we speak on, or would you accept judgment now?" But TenSoon shakes his head. "We both know that OreSeur’s death has little to do with why I am here," he says softly. The real reason is much bigger. "Very well," KanPaar says. "Let us move on, then." He looks at TenSoon, and his voice echoes in the silent cavern. "Why don’t you tell the First Generation why you broke Contract with your master? Why did you disobey him and help his enemy instead?"
</Person1><Person1> This is the real accusation. TenSoon closes his eyes. He remembers that day, over a year ago. He remembers watching his master, Zane, fight Vin. Zane was TenSoon's master. He held the contract. TenSoon's job was to spy on Vin for Zane. But, against all his training, TenSoon helped Vin. And in that moment, he revealed the greatest secret of the kandra. He showed her their weakness. He showed her how she could control him completely. The kandra serve humans in contracts so this secret is never discovered. They choose to be servants so they do not become slaves. TenSoon gave that secret away.
</Person1><Person1> He opens his eyes. He looks at all the watching kandra. This is the moment he has been waiting for. This is why he demanded the trial. He stands up tall and his voice is clear and strong. "I didn't break my Contract," he announces. What could he possibly mean? He just admitted that he helped Vin instead of his master, Zane. How can he say he didn't break his contract? We will have to wait to hear his explanation. Next time, TenSoon will talk about a different kind of contract. A much older, more important one. He will speak of Vin not as an enemy, but as their Mother. Join us then to uncover the rest of TenSoon's incredible story.</Person1>
