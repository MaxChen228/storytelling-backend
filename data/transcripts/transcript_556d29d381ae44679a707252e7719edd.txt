<Person1> <speak> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings.  Last time, we left Gaal Dornick with the brilliant Hari Seldon. Seldon had just shown Gaal a terrifying future. Using math, he proved that the great city of Trantor would be destroyed in three hundred years. Seldon even said there was a small chance he would be executed. But he didn't seem worried. He just told Gaal, "You will meet me, I suppose, at the University tomorrow?" And Gaal promised he would be there.  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> But Gaal did not keep his promise. He couldn't.  The next morning, a soft buzzer woke him up. A polite voice from the hotel desk told him something terrible. He was under detention. This means he was a prisoner in his own room. The police said he could not leave. Gaal jumped out of bed and ran to the door. He tried to open it. It was locked. Imagine that feeling. You are on a new planet, in a huge city, and suddenly, you are trapped. All he could do was get dressed and wait.  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> Soon, men came for him. They were polite, but firm. They took him to another room, but it was still a prison. They started asking questions. Over and over again. They asked about his home, his school, his job with Dr. Seldon. It was all very civilized, very calm. But Gaal was scared. They kept asking, "What is the Seldon Project about? What are your secret instructions?" Gaal told them the truth. He said, "I don't know. I am just a mathematician. I am not interested in politics."  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> Then, the main questioner, the inquisitor, asked something very specific. He leaned forward and said, "When will Trantor be destroyed?" Gaal felt very warm. He started to sweat. He knew the answer, but he was afraid to say it. He tried to be careful. He said, "I cannot say from my own knowledge." But the inquisitor knew. He told Gaal, "We followed you. We heard your conversation with Dr. Seldon." Gaal had no choice. He had to tell them. "He said Trantor would be destroyed within three centuries," Gaal admitted. The inquisitor asked if the math was correct. Gaal felt a moment of bravery. He said, "If Dr. Seldon says it is valid, it is valid."  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> Mmm... let's pause here for our Language Spotlight. Gaal says Seldon's math is valid. Valid  (有效的)  means something is based on truth or fact. It's correct and can be accepted. For example, a valid ticket lets you get on the train. A valid reason is a good reason. Here, Gaal is saying Seldon's math is true. He trusts it completely. So, the math is valid.  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> After the questioning, Gaal demanded a lawyer. And he got one. A tall, thin man named Lors Avakim arrived. He said Dr. Seldon had sent him. Gaal was upset and scared. He told Avakim, "I demand to see the Emperor! I am innocent!" But Avakim was very calm. He put a small recorder on the table. He told Gaal that the police were listening, but his special recorder could block them. They could speak freely. But then Avakim told him something shocking. Appealing to the Emperor was useless. The Emperor was not really in charge. A group of powerful families, the Commission of Public Safety, controlled everything.  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> Gaal became angry. He asked, "If Dr. Seldon is so good at predicting the future, why didn't he predict my arrest this morning and warn me?" And here, my friends, is the biggest surprise. Avakim looked at Gaal and said that Dr. Seldon did know. In fact, Seldon wanted Gaal to be arrested. Can you believe it? Seldon visited Gaal the day before to make the police act faster. Gaal's arrest was part of the plan. It was necessary to move the project forward.  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> Gaal was just a piece in a much larger game. Avakim tried to comfort him. He said the plan had a 99.9% chance of success for the project. For Gaal himself? The chance of a good outcome was... 77.2%. That meant there was a real chance Gaal could go to prison, or worse. Gaal was terrified. He demanded to see Seldon. But Avakim delivered the final piece of bad news. "I cannot," he said. "Dr. Seldon is himself arrested." And just then, a guard burst in, took the special recorder, and Avakim left. Gaal was alone again.  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> So, the takeaway from this part is huge. We learn that Seldon's psychohistory is not just about predicting the future. It's about controlling it. Seldon is not just an observer; he is an actor. He is willing to sacrifice people, including himself and young Gaal, to make his plan work. Gaal is no longer just a mathematician starting a new job. He is a key part of a dangerous, galaxy-changing plan he doesn't even understand yet.  
</Person1><Person1> <speak> And this leads us directly to the trial. Both Gaal and Seldon are on trial, in a secret room filled with powerful lords who hate them. And in this trial, Seldon is about to reveal a secret far more shocking than the fall of Trantor. He will tell them that it’s not just one city that will fall... but the entire Galactic Empire. The story is getting so much bigger. Join me next time to hear what happens.  </Person1>
