<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! I’m so glad you’re back with us. Last time, we left Vin in a really intense moment. She had just defeated a huge, thirteen-foot-tall koloss, a truly impossible fight. But as she stood there, she realized a scary truth… someone else was controlling this entire army from far away.
</Person1><Person1>Now, let's picture the scene. Vin stands up straight. In the distance, through the falling ash, she can see Elend’s army. It’s a small army, and they look… desperate. But they are still fighting. They haven’t given up. Under Elend’s leadership, they held their ground. Vin realizes that the humans fighting so bravely will confuse the koloss, just like she does. The koloss won't understand how such a small group can fight so hard. They will just see a small army that refuses to fall.
</Person1><Person1>Vin turns back to the koloss around her. They are coming toward her again, but this time, it’s different. They move with more… trepidation. Mmm, that’s a great word. <lang xml:lang="en-US">Trepidation. It means they are feeling fear or worry about what might happen. They are scared of her, but they still have to attack. It’s a very strange thing about the koloss. They feel fear, but they cannot retreat. They can’t run away. But their fear makes them weaker. Vin can see it in their eyes, in the way they walk. They are close to breaking.
</Person1><Person1>And this gives Vin an idea. A brilliant, dangerous idea. She burns brass. This is her Allomantic power that lets her affect the emotions of others. She Pushes on the feelings of a smaller koloss nearby. At first, the creature resists her. So, she shoves harder with her mind. And then… something inside the creature breaks. It becomes hers. The person controlling the army is too far away, and focused on too many other koloss. This one, with its mind so full of fear and confusion, comes completely under Vin’s control.
</Person1><Person1>Immediately, she gives it a new order: attack your friends. The koloss turns and attacks the other koloss next to it. It is killed a moment later, of course, but not before it takes two others down with it. It worked. So, as Vin continues to fight with her sword, she secretly snatches control of another koloss mind… and then another. She does it randomly, so no one can see the pattern. Soon, the area around her is just… chaos. And she has a small group of koloss fighting for her. Every time one of her new soldiers falls, she just replaces it with two more.
</Person1><Person1>She takes a quick look over at Elend’s army again. And she feels… relieved. A large group of koloss is now fighting with the humans. Elend is there, moving among them. He isn’t fighting with a sword anymore. He is focused, just like her, on snatching koloss minds, one by one. Mmm… so this was his plan all along. It was a gamble for him to come here. A <lang xml:lang="en-US">gamble is a risky action, one where you don't know the result. You just hope it works. And Elend's gamble… it was working. Vin is just glad she arrived in time to help him.
</Person1><Person1>So, she stops fighting with her sword. Instead, she focuses all her energy on commanding her own small koloss army, adding new members one at a time. Soon, she has almost a hundred koloss fighting for her. It won’t be long now, she thinks.
</Person1><Person1>And she’s right. Soon, she sees a speck in the sky, moving fast through the ash. The speck gets closer, and it becomes a person in dark robes. He is jumping over the army, Pushing down on the swords of the koloss to fly through the air. He is tall and bald, and his face is covered in tattoos. And then Vin sees it. The two thick metal spikes driven right through his eyes. It’s a Steel Inquisitor. A new one she doesn’t recognize.
</Person1><Person1>He lands hard, cutting down one of Vin’s koloss with two black axes. He turns his sightless eyes toward Vin. And even though she is so powerful, Vin feels a little bit of panic. Suddenly, memories flash in her mind. A dark, rainy night. The pain in her side from an old fight. The long night she was a captive in the Lord Ruler’s palace. And Kelsier… her teacher, her friend… dying on the streets. No. She has to focus.
</Person1><Person1>She burns electrum, another metal. This creates a cloud of shadows around her, showing all the possible things she might do next. It also makes her immune to atium, a very powerful metal that lets you see the future. It’s a good defense, just in case. She grits her teeth and runs forward. She jumps, Pushing on a fallen sword to fly toward the Inquisitor. He swings his axes, but Vin Pulls herself to the side at the last second. She Pulls a sword from a nearby koloss, catches it in the air, and Pushes it at the Inquisitor. But he just pushes the huge weapon away easily, without even looking.
</Person1><Person1>No more memories! Vin tells herself. Focus on the moment. She lands, her foot slipping in koloss blood, and runs at him again. She wanted this. She lured him out by controlling his koloss. Now, she has to deal with him. She takes out a glass dagger, because he can’t Push on glass, and flares her pewter. This gives her body incredible speed, strength, and balance. But… the Inquisitor also has pewter. They are equal in strength. Except for one thing. The Inquisitor has a weakness.
</Person1><Person1>Vin ducks under an axe. She Pulls on a sword to move faster, then Pushes on it to throw herself forward. She tries to stab his neck. He blocks her with his hand. But with her other hand, she grabs his robe. Then, she flares iron and Pulls on a dozen swords behind her, all at once. The sudden, powerful Pull yanks her backward. She holds onto the robe, and the fabric rips away. The Inquisitor’s back is now exposed.
</Person1><Person1>She was looking for a single spike, just like the ones in his eyes. Every Inquisitor has one, right between their shoulder blades. If you pull it out, they die. It’s their greatest secret… their greatest weakness. But… it’s not there. Or, it is there, but it’s hidden. It's covered by a metal shield, like a turtle’s shell, protecting his entire back. The Inquisitor turns and smiles. He knows what she was looking for. And he knows she can’t get to it.
</Person1><Person1>Vin curses. This is bad. The Lord Ruler always wanted his servants to have weaknesses, so he could control them. This Inquisitor… he found a way to protect himself. And now, Vin has no time to think. The koloss are still attacking. She jumps over a swinging sword and lands on a small hill away from the main fight. The Inquisitor follows her. He swings his axe, and Vin dodges, but not fast enough. The blade cuts her arm. Warm blood runs down her wrist. The blood is red, just like the sun in this strange world.
</Person1><Person1>She growls and faces her enemy. That smile on his face… it’s so disturbing. She throws herself forward to strike again. But just then, something flashes in the air.
</Person1><Person1>Help has arrived. But who is it? And can even two people be enough to defeat a protected Inquisitor? Next time, we will see Elend join the fight, and witness a power so great it might just be able to stop this entire war. Thank you for listening, and I can’t wait to continue the story with you.</Person1>
