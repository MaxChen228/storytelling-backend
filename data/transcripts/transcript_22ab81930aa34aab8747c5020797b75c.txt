<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Salvor Hardin was on Anacreon, hiding in a crowd. He watched the big celebration for the new king, waiting for a crisis he knew was coming. Now, the party is in full swing, and things are about to get very, very interesting.
</Person1><Person2> It’s late, past eleven o’clock. Can you picture the scene? A huge, crowded room filled with music and talking. Hardin is there, feeling a little anxious. He <lang xml:lang="en-US">fidgeted, which means he moved around a lot because he was nervous. He even stood on his toes, trying to see better over everyone's heads. He felt an impulse, a sudden wish, to stand on a chair! But of course, he didn't.
</Person2><Person1> Mmm, I can just feel that impatience. He’s waiting for something. And then, he sees him. A man named Wienis is walking through the crowd. Wienis is the prince regent, the temporary ruler. As soon as Hardin sees him, he relaxes. The wait is over. Wienis moves slowly, stopping to talk to powerful nobles. Finally, he reaches Hardin.
</Person1><Person2> Wienis has a strange smile on his face. It's called a <lang xml:lang="en-US">smirk. A smirk is a smile that isn't very nice. It’s a smile that says, ‘I know something you don’t.’ His eyes have little glints of satisfaction in them. He’s happy about something. He leans in and speaks in a low voice. "My dear Hardin," he says, "you must expect to be bored when you refuse to tell people who you are."
</Person2><Person1> But Hardin isn’t bored at all. He tells Wienis that everything is very interesting. Then Wienis invites him to his private chambers. A place where they can talk with more privacy. As they walk away together, some of the rich ladies stare. They wonder, who is this normal-looking stranger with the prince regent?
</Person1><Person2> In Wienis’s private room, Hardin finally relaxes. Wienis pours him a glass of very old, expensive wine. It's a royal drink. They raise their glasses. "To Lepold the First, King of Anacreon," Hardin says politely. They drink. And then Wienis adds something else. He says the king will soon be Emperor of the whole area. Maybe, one day, emperor of the whole galaxy.
</Person2><Person1> An emperor? Hardin is curious. "By Anacreon?" he asks. Wienis says yes, with help from Hardin's planet, the Foundation. With the Foundation’s science, Anacreon would be the strongest. But Hardin shakes his head. He explains that the Foundation must help everyone. It cannot play favorites, which means it cannot choose one side over another.
</Person1><Person2> I see. So the Foundation is supposed to be neutral. But Wienis just smiles that smirk again. He says he understands that the Foundation would never cooperate on its own. He reminds Hardin of a time before, when he threatened war to get what he wanted. "And that threat," Wienis says, "always stood."
</Person2><Person1> "And it still stands now?" Hardin asks. Wienis looks at the clock. He says it’s too late for threats now. He then changes the subject. He talks about Hardin’s famous belief. "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent." That’s a powerful idea, isn't it? It means that only people who aren't smart enough to find a better way use violence.
</Person1><Person2> Yes, it is. But Wienis doesn't agree. He says he believes in direct action. He carves a straight path to what he wants. And then Hardin says something very bold. He suggests that Wienis is carving a path directly to the throne for himself. He even mentions the king's father, who died in a way that was… unfortunate. And that the young king himself is not very healthy.
</Person2><Person1> Ooh, that was a direct hit! Wienis gets angry. His voice grows harder. He warns Hardin to be careful. He says he is not a man who is frightened by words or difficulties. He faces problems boldly. "What difficulty are you facing now?" Hardin asks. And that’s when Wienis reveals his trap.
</Person1><Person2> He tells Hardin that his policy of peace has led to big mistakes. "For instance," Wienis says, "you came to Anacreon alone. And you came to my chambers alone." Hardin looks around. He doesn’t see a problem. But Wienis explains. "Outside this room are five guards," he says. "They are ready to shoot. I don't think you can leave, Hardin."
</Person2><Person1> Wow. So Hardin is a prisoner. But he doesn't seem scared. He just lifts his eyebrows. Then Wienis reveals his second, bigger trap. He says that Hardin's planet, Terminus, is undefended. It has no protection. And while Terminus was helpless, it helped Anacreon build a great navy. A navy that is now irresistible, or impossible to stop.
</Person1><Person2> This is bad. This is really bad. Wienis isn't just threatening war. He tells Hardin that his ships left Anacreon an hour ago. They are on their way to attack Terminus. The first shot will be fired at noon tomorrow. "You may consider yourself a prisoner of war," Wienis says with a contemptuous chuckle, a laugh that shows he thinks Hardin is foolish.
</Person2><Person1> So, this is it. The crisis has arrived. Hardin is trapped. His planet is about to be attacked. What can he possibly do? But Hardin… he just seems… disappointed. He tells Wienis he thought the attack would start at midnight, at the moment of the coronation. He says it would have been more dramatic. More theatrical. (soft laugh) Can you believe it?
</Person1><Person2> That's… a very strange reaction. Wienis is confused. He doesn’t understand what Hardin is talking about. "What in Space are you talking about?" he asks. And that's when Hardin smiles. "Don't you understand?" he says softly. "I had set my counterstroke for midnight."
</Person2><Person1> A counterstroke! An attack made in response to an enemy's attack. Wienis doesn't believe him. He thinks Hardin is bluffing, or pretending. But Hardin is serious. He says he won’t fire a single shot. His plan is different. A week ago, he sent a secret message. He told every priest on the planet Anacreon that at midnight tonight, the planet goes under the <lang xml:lang="en-US">interdict.
</Person1><Person2> The interdict? What does that mean? Hardin explains. It means every single priest on Anacreon is going on strike. They will stop all religious services. And the people of Anacreon are very religious. An attack on the Foundation, the center of their religion, is a sacrilege—a terrible crime against their beliefs.
</Person2><Person1> Exactly! Hardin tells Wienis that right now, every temple is filled with people. And the priests are telling them that their own government has started a wicked, unholy war. The people will be furious. It’s almost midnight. "You'd better go watch," Hardin says calmly. He leans back, pours another glass of wine, and stares at the ceiling, completely unafraid.
</Person1><Person2> What an incredible turnaround! Hardin used religion as his weapon. He turned the people of Anacreon against their own leader. The clock is ticking down to midnight. And as we'll find out next time, that’s when everything changes. The lights in the palace will suddenly go out. A mob, led by the High Priest, will surround the building. We will see Hardin’s brilliant plan unfold, and discover another secret he placed on Wienis’s own flagship. The battle for the Foundation has begun, but not with guns… with ideas.
