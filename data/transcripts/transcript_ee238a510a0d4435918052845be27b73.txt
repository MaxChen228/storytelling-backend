<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. When we last left our story, the Foundation was teetering on the edge of its third Seldon Crisis. Remember, Hober Mallow, our master trader, had just refused a seat on the council, choosing instead to embark on a secret mission, taking the skeptical Jaim Twer with him. With no clear plan but a resolve to improvise, they journeyed towards the unknown. And now… we find them.
</Person1><Person1>Picture the place they’ve landed: the planet Korell. The word that comes to mind is decay. This isn't a bustling center of commerce. No, materially, its prosperity is low. The grand Galactic Empire is just a memory here, testified only by silent memorials and broken buildings. The Foundation's influence hasn't arrived yet, and the local ruler, a man named Commdor Asper Argo, seems determined it never will. He strictly regulates traders and completely prohibits missionaries.
</Person1><Person1>So the spaceport itself is, as you might imagine, decrepit. That's our first vocabulary spotlight today: decrepit. It means old and in very bad condition, worn out by long use. The hangars are described as "moldering"—another great word, suggesting a damp, rotting atmosphere. You can almost smell the decay, can't you? Inside their ship, the Far Star, the crew feels this oppressive atmosphere. Jaim Twer is so agitated he can’t sit still, just fretting over a game of cards.
</Person1><Person1>But Hober Mallow… he sees something different. While Twer sees ruin, Mallow stares out the viewport and says thoughtfully, "Good trading material here." What an interesting contrast! He sees opportunity where everyone else sees neglect. For a week, they've been stuck. A few battered Korellian ships keep a fearful distance, and Mallow's requests to meet the government have been ignored. Still, he repeats, "You might call this virgin territory."
</Person1><Person1>This is too much for Twer. He throws his cards down, completely exasperated. "What the devil do you intend doing, Mallow?" he demands. The crew is grumbling, the officers are worried, and Twer… well, Twer thinks Mallow is, in his words, "going it blind." And that's our second phrase: going it blind. It’s an idiom that means to do something without having enough information or a clear plan. Twer is terrified they're just sitting ducks, waiting to be blown up.
</Person1><Person1>Mallow’s response is calm, almost chillingly so. He admits it's a "pretty problem." He walks Twer through his logic. Maybe the Korellians are weak and afraid to show their few nuclear-powered ships. Or maybe they have plenty of power but are afraid the Foundation is suspicious of them. He says, "We're both waiting. They don't know what I'm doing here and I don't know what they've got here." He acknowledges the danger, but what else can they do? They have to see who makes the first move.
</Person1><Person1>And then, just as the tension is at its peak, the visiplate buzzes. A watch sergeant appears, his face grim. "Pardon, sir. The men have given entry to a Foundation missionary." A missionary! The one thing the Commdor strictly prohibits. Mallow's face grows livid—furious. He immediately orders the crew to battle stations. The calm is shattered. The waiting is over.
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… this is where we see Mallow’s leadership style in full force. He enters the crew's lounge, a space now buzzing with tension. He summons his officers. First, he deals with the breach of discipline. The sergeant who let the missionary in steps forward. He explains the men felt a sense of solidarity—the missionary was "one of us." Mallow's response is ice cold. "I sympathize with your feelings, sergeant," he says, before relieving the man of his duties and confining the responsible crew members to their quarters. Twer protests, but Mallow cuts him off. He says, "There's no merit in discipline under ideal circumstances. I'll have it in the face of death, or it's useless." What a powerful, and perhaps frightening, philosophy.
</Person1><Person1>Then, he turns to the missionary. The man, whose name is Jord Parma, is clearly injured and in shock. He’s wearing the scarlet robes of his order, and his eyes are blank. When Mallow asks his name, he bursts into a feverish plea, begging them as "Children of the Spirit" to save him from the "heathen" Korellians. Twer is moved, his voice husky with pity, urging Mallow to help the man. But Mallow shoves him back, his focus absolute.
</Person1><Person1>And at that exact moment? An alarm blares through the ship! "Enemy units in sight! Instruction desired!" Mallow swears, looks out the viewport, and sees not warships, but a mob. A rolling rabble of thousands of Korellians, lit by the cold, hard light of magnesium flares, is surrounding the port and moving closer.
</Person1><Person1>The final confrontation of the chapter is between Mallow and Twer. Twer grabs Mallow's shoulder, hissing that they are bound by honor and decency to protect the priest. But Mallow’s patience is gone. His voice is incisive, deadly serious. "I've got more to do here than guard missionaries," he says. And then he delivers a chilling threat: "if you try to stop me, I'll tear out your stinking windpipe."
</Person1><Person1>So we're left on this incredible cliffhanger. A mob outside, a terrified priest inside, and a captain who seems willing to sacrifice anyone, and any principle, for a mission we still don't fully understand. It forces us to ask, what is the right thing to do here? Is Mallow a ruthless monster, or is he a brilliant strategist making an impossible choice? It seems his cold logic is about to be put to the ultimate test.
</Person1><Person1>And here’s a little glimpse of what’s to come: Mallow will confront this angry mob, but not in the way you might expect. He will make a decision regarding the missionary that will shock his crew. But he suspects this entire incident, the convenient arrival of a priest just as tensions are high, isn't a coincidence. He believes it was a trap, a test. And his response to that test will earn him a direct invitation from the one person he needs to see: the ruler of Korell, Commdor Asper himself. We are about to see what kind of game Hober Mallow is truly playing. Join me next time as we find out.</Person1>
