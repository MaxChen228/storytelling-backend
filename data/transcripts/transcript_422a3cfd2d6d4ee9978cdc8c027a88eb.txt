<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, the young and ambitious politician, Sef Sermak, confronted Mayor Hardin. Sermak accused Hardin of being weak and demanded he resign. He believes Hardin’s peaceful policies are putting their home, Terminus, in great danger. Let's see how Hardin responds.
</Person1><Person2>Hardin disagrees completely. He tells Sermak, "That was the time to begin all-out prevention of war." He explains his strategy. He didn’t appease the Four Kingdoms; he controlled them. Imagine playing a game with four powerful players. Hardin says he played them against each other. He helped one, then another, always keeping them in balance.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly! He gave them science, medicine, and education. This made Terminus very valuable to them. It was more useful as a friendly, flourishing planet than as a prize to win in a war. And this strategy worked for thirty years! It kept the peace. So, Hardin’s plan was not weak; it was clever. He avoided war by making Terminus too important to attack.
</Person1><Person2>But Sermak sees a problem. He says, "Yes, but you were forced to surround these scientific gifts with the most outrageous mummery." Mmm… that’s an interesting word. Mummery. It means silly, meaningless ceremonies or actions. It’s like a big performance that isn't real. Sermak is saying that Hardin turned science into a fake religion.
</Person2><Person1>That's right. He says Hardin created priests and complicated rituals. He calls it "balderdash," which means nonsense. Sermak thinks this is a huge mistake. But Hardin just frowns. He doesn't think it's a big deal. He explains that the people of the Four Kingdoms, the "barbarians," saw science as magic. So, it was easier to give it to them as a religion.
</Person1><Person2>I see. So, Hardin used their beliefs to his advantage. He says the priesthood just… grew by itself. And helping it along was simply "the line of least resistance," meaning it was the easiest way to get things done. He calls it a minor matter, something not very important. But Sermak is sharp. He points out that these priests are in charge of the power plants. And that is definitely not a minor matter!
</Person2><Person1>Hardin agrees, but he isn't worried. He explains that the Foundation trained these priests. Their knowledge is purely empirical. ‘Empirical’ means they know how to do things, but they don't know why they work. They follow instructions and believe in the religious mummery around them. They don't understand the real science.
</Person1><Person2>Sermak asks a very smart question, though. What if one of these priests is a genius? What if someone sees through the mummery? What if they learn the real science and sell it to the highest bidder? Then Terminus would lose all its value. Hardin dismisses this. He says the best students come to the Foundation, and the very best stay here to do research. He believes the priests who go back are not smart enough to understand nuclear power or hyperwarp theory. He tells Sermak his idea of science is romantic and foolish.
</Person2><Person1>And right at that moment, the scene changes. Hardin’s assistant, Yohan Lee, who had left the room earlier, comes back. He whispers something to Hardin and gives him a small leaden cylinder. A secret message. Hardin twists it open. A rolled paper falls out. He reads it in a single glance, his eyes never leaving Sermak and his men. Can you picture the tension in that room?
</Person1><Person2>Wow, what a power move. While reading this secret message, he tells Sermak's group, "the Government is of the opinion that it knows what it is doing." Then he casually tosses the message into an incinerator. It’s completely gone. He then ends the meeting, shakes their hands, and they leave. He is in total control.
</Person2><Person1>After they're gone, Hardin lets out a dry chuckle. He asks Lee what he thought of that "battle of bluffs." A bluff is when you pretend to be stronger or know more than you do. But Lee is worried. He thinks Sermak might actually win the next election. He even reminds Hardin that they once used violence to take power themselves, even though Hardin says violence is "the last refuge of the incompetent."
</Person1><Person2>So they have a history! Hardin tells Lee not to worry. He says their own takeover was smooth and necessary. He tells Lee to have his men watch Sermak, but to do it nicely. And Lee just laughs a sour laugh. He says he’s already been watching Sermak and his men for a month. He didn't wait for Hardin's order! (soft laugh) These two know each other very well.
</Person2><Person1>They really do. Then, Hardin shares the secret message. He says it softly: Ambassador Verisof is returning from Anacreon. Lee is horrified. He asks, "Are things breaking already?" This means, is the crisis starting now? Hardin doesn't know for sure, but he thinks it might be. Lee is worried because Hardin is too deep and plays his game "close to his chest," which means he keeps his plans very secret.
</Person1><Person2>The chapter then shifts. We learn about one of Hardin’s famous sayings, or epigrams. He said: "It pays to be obvious, especially if you have a reputation for subtlety." Subtlety is being clever in a way that is difficult to notice. So, if everyone thinks you are secretive and clever, the best way to hide is to act completely normal and obvious.
</Person2><Person1>And that’s exactly what Ambassador Poly Verisof does. He lives a double life on Anacreon. To the people, he is a high priest of the science-religion. But to the king, he is just an ambassador from a powerful world. It's a very uncomfortable job. So, his secret trip back to Terminus feels like a holiday.
</Person1><Person2>And how does he travel secretly? By being completely obvious! He changes into normal clothes, buys a second-class ticket on a passenger ship, and lands at the public spaceport. He calls City Hall from a public phone, using a fake name, Jan Smite. Then he just sits on a park bench and reads the newspaper until his appointment. No one even looks at him twice. It’s brilliant!
</Person2><Person1>It really is. When he finally meets Hardin, they chat like old friends. Verisof tells a funny story about a priest on his ship who tried to convert him away from "sordid materialism," not knowing he was talking to his own high priest! They laugh about how powerful the "religion of science" has become. Verisof says that when the old Empire failed, science had to return in a new form—as a religion. And it’s working beautifully.
</Person1><Person2>Mmm, it’s a fascinating strategy. But Verisof is not back for a holiday chat. He carries urgent news from Anacreon, news that made him risk this secret journey. Next time, we will find out what he has to say. He brings a warning about a dangerous and ambitious prince, a powerful old warship from the Empire, and a demand that could push Terminus into the war Hardin has worked so hard to prevent. I can’t wait to see what happens. Join us next time!</Person2>
