<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we saw Elend decide to be a strong leader for his friends. They were losing hope, and he knew he had to help them. Now, we join them in a very important meeting.
</Person1><Person1> Picture a large tent. Inside, it is a little dark. A big map hangs on one wall. Elend, the emperor, stands near it. His friends are all there. Vin sits in the back, near the shadows. She always feels safer there. The strong man, Ham, is there. The funny man, Breeze, is there too. And Sazed is there, very quiet and very sad.
</Person1><Person1> There is also a king named Cett. He is not a very friendly man. He sits at the front of the group. He cannot walk, but he is still very powerful. Elend points to the map on the wall. He says, “All right.” The group moves closer to look.
</Person1><Person1> The map shows their world. But there are big circles drawn on it. Elend explains what the circles mean. The mists are growing. Every day, they cover more and more land. The circles show where there is still sunlight. The biggest circle on the outside shows where the mists never leave. There is no sun there at all. Then, Elend moves his finger to a smaller circle. He says this line shows where there are only four hours of daylight. Not much time for the sun.
</Person1><Person1> Then, he points to the smallest circle. It is in the very middle of the map. He says, “This is where we can grow food this summer.” The room becomes silent. Everyone looks at the tiny circle. They understand the terrible problem. Soon, there will be no food for most people in the empire. It is a horrible discovery.
</Person1><Person1> Vin feels afraid. She hears a voice in her head. It is the voice of her brother, Reen. He always told her that hope is for foolish people. He taught her to trust no one. She tries to push the voice away. Her friend Kelsier taught her that it is possible to trust people and to survive. But sometimes, she still hears Reen's words.
</Person1><Person1> Mmm… in this part of the story, they talk about their "predicament." That is a useful word. A predicament is a difficult or bad situation. It is when you have a very big problem, and you do not know what to do. The small circle on the map shows their predicament. They have no sun and will soon have no food. That is a very, very bad predicament.
</Person1><Person1> Elend says their predicament is impossible. He means their problem is extremely hard to solve. So, what can they do? Elend asks his friends for their ideas. Breeze suggests they use the power from the Well of Ascension. But Vin speaks up. She says the power is gone. It will not return for a thousand years. So, that is not an option.
</Person1><Person1> Ham has another idea. He asks, “Can we grow plants that need very little light? Like mushrooms?” It is a good thought. But Elend thinks they cannot feed an entire empire with just mushrooms. It is not enough. Everyone is quiet again. They feel helpless. They cannot fight the mists with an army. The mists bring a slow, terrible death.
</Person1><Person1> Then, Elend talks about the Lord Ruler. The Lord Ruler was the emperor for a thousand years. He knew this would happen one day. So he prepared. He made secret storage caverns, full of food and supplies. They have found some of these places. But they have not found the last one. Elend says, “We must find the last cache.” A cache is a secret hiding place for supplies. Elend thinks this last cache has the answers they need.
</Person1><Person1> But King Cett does not trust the Lord Ruler. (soft laugh) He thinks the food in the cache might be poison. He is not a very trusting person. But Elend disagrees. He thinks the Lord Ruler was not completely evil. He thinks he wanted his empire to survive. Elend believes the last storage cache is their only hope.
</Person1><Person1> So, in this chapter, the group finally understands how serious their situation is. The world is getting darker. Food is running out. Their hope feels very small. But Elend now has a plan. He wants to find the Lord Ruler's last secret storage place.
</Person1><Person1> And that is where they will go next. Elend decides the army must march to a place called Fadrex City. He believes the last cache is hidden there. But Fadrex City is far away, and it is a dangerous place. What will they find? And what new dangers will they face on their journey? We will find out next time.
