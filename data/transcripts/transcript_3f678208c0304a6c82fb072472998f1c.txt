<Person1>Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we felt the tension building on the planet Terminus. Mayor Hardin was worried. A powerful neighbor, Anacreon, sent an envoy, a military man named Anselm haut Rodric. Rodric arrived, looking at everything with sharp eyes, and was about to meet the leader of Terminus, the scholar Dr. Pirenne. Today, we see what happens when a soldier meets a scholar.
</Person1><Person2>I'm really curious about this meeting. A soldier and a scholar... they see the world so differently.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. And Rodric is immediately... surprised. He asks Hardin, "Your leader... is a Doctor? A scholar?" He can't believe it. He expected a general, or a powerful governor.
</Person1><Person2>So he sees a scholar as weak, maybe?
</Person2><Person1>It seems that way. But Hardin explains, "We're a scientific foundation... under the direct control of the Emperor." He says this proudly. But you can feel Rodric thinking, "A foundation? Not a country? Mmm... interesting."
</Person1><Person2>He's definitely looking for weaknesses.
</Person2><Person1>He is. Later, Pirenne gives Rodric a tour of the giant Encyclopedia building. Can you imagine it? Walking through huge rooms, filled with machines and films. Pirenne is so excited, talking fast about all the important work they are doing.
</Person1><Person2>But Rodric probably doesn't care about a big library.
</Person2><Person1>Not at all. The story says his eyes are "glazed." Mmm... this means he looks very bored, like he is not really listening. Finally, after seeing everything, Rodric asks a simple, but powerful question. He says, "This is all very interesting, but... what good is it?"
</Person1><Person2>Oh, wow. That's a direct hit. What does Pirenne say?
</Person2><Person1>Nothing. Pirenne... he has no answer. His face says everything. He is shocked, maybe even insulted that someone would ask that question.
</Person1><Person2>That silence is a very bad sign for their negotiations.
</Person2><Person1>It gets worse. That evening, they sit on a balcony under the stars. The air is warm. Mayor Hardin is smoking a rare cigar, trying to relax. But Rodric is ready for business. "And now," he says with a heavy voice, "to serious matters."
</Person1><Person2>Here we go. The real reason for his visit.
</Person2><Person1>Yes. Pirenne is cold. He still believes the old rules will protect them. He tells Rodric, "We are part of the personal domain of his august majesty, the Emperor." He sounds so sure of himself.
</Person1><Person2>But does Rodric care about an emperor who is so far away?
</Person2><Person1>Not at all. Rodric just... blows smoke rings. He says that's a nice theory, but the Emperor is far away. Anacreon is close. Smyrno, another new kingdom, is also close. He warns them, "We're liable to see Terminus taken over by Smyrno at any time."
</Person1><Person2>So he's using fear to make his point.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. And then he reveals his plan. Anacreon will "protect" them. They will build a military base on Terminus.
</Person1><Person2>Ah, but "protection" always has a price.
</Person2><Person1>Hardin understands immediately. He leans forward. "Now we're getting to the nub." He says, "Terminus is to be a protectorate and to pay tribute." Rodric tries to correct him, "Not tribute. Taxes." But it's the same thing, isn't it?
</Person1><Person2>It is. How does Pirenne react to that?
</Person2><Person1>Pirenne is furious! He bangs his hand on his chair and shouts that they are a tax-free institution. But Rodric's answer is simple and terrifying. He says, "We are the State now. And we're not supporting you."
</Person1><Person2>The power has shifted, and Pirenne doesn't see it yet.
</Person2><Person1>Mmm... there were two really great phrases in that conversation. The first was when Rodric said it was time to "clear away some of the underbrush" (清除一些障碍). (pause) This is a wonderful way to say you want to talk about the small things first, to get them out of the way before the big, important conversation. It’s like clearing small sticks and leaves from a path before you can walk on it.
</Person1><Person2>I like that. It’s very visual. What was the second phrase?
</Person2><Person1>It was from Hardin. He said, "Now we're getting to the nub" (触及核心). The "nub" is the very center, the most important part of something. So when Hardin said this, he meant, "Ah, now we are finally talking about the real issue, the most important point": money and control.
</Person1><Person2>Got it. So after Pirenne's outburst, what happens? How can they pay these "taxes"?
</Person2><Person1>Well, that's where Hardin plays a clever card. He asks how Anacreon wants to be paid. Gold? Other valuable metals? And then he laughs. "We have no metals," he says. He even tosses Rodric a coin made of plain steel.
</Person1><Person2>No way! A whole planet with no resources? That must have surprised Rodric.
</Person2><Person1>It did. He's confused. But then, he has a new, even more dangerous idea. He says, "Well, you might pay with land." He wants to give parts of Terminus to the rich nobles of Anacreon.
</Person1><Person2>So, colonization. He wants to take over their world piece by piece.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. He even tries to bribe Pirenne, offering him a title and an estate if he agrees. It's a shocking offer.
</Person1><Person2>So what does this all mean? What's the big picture here?
</Person2><Person1>We see two different worlds crashing into each other. Pirenne’s world is based on knowledge, history, and the rules of a dying Empire. Rodric’s world is based on power, military strength, and what is happening right now.
</Person1><Person2>Pirenne believes a piece of paper with the Emperor's seal can stop an army.
</Person2><Person1>And Rodric believes only an army can stop an army. And poor Hardin is stuck in the middle, trying to find a realistic path. It really makes you think... when reality changes, do old ideas still protect you?
</Person1><Person2>That is a very deep question. And it seems like Hardin knows the answer is no.
</Person2><Person1>He does. And that is the question he is now facing. He knows Pirenne's ideas are not enough. He has a secret plan of his own. It's a big gamble, something that could make Terminus seem very strong... or could fail completely. And to make his plan work, he first has to fight his own leaders. We'll find out what his dangerous idea is... in our next chapter. I can't wait to see what happens next. Goodbye for now!</Person1>
