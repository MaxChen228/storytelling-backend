<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we felt the cold fear in the Anacreon palace. Young King Lepold learned from his uncle Wienis that war with the Foundation was coming, and that he, Lepold, was in great danger... even from his own family. Today, we leave the palace and travel to the Foundation's home, where a different kind of storm is brewing.
</Person1><Person2>I'm so curious to see what's happening on the other side of this conflict.
</Person2><Person1>Let's find out. Imagine a short winter day, the sky full of clouds. As evening arrives, snow begins to fall, making the world outside quiet and dark. Inside a warm room, a group of men are meeting. They are the leaders of the Action Party, a group that does not agree with the Foundation’s leader, Salvor Hardin. The mood in the room is not happy. It is… depressed. Heavy.
</Person1><Person2>That sounds very serious. Who are these men?
</Person2><Person1>Their leader is a man named Sermak. And with them is Lewis Bort, who has just returned from a secret trip. He was on Anacreon, the planet of King Lepold. Everyone waits to hear his news. And his first words are not good. He looks at his friends and says, "I'm afraid our position is a 'Lost Cause.'"
</Person1><Person2>A 'Lost Cause'? What does he mean by that?
</Person2><Person1>Mmm, that's a great question. When someone says a plan is a 'Lost Cause,' it means there is no hope. It means they believe it is impossible to win. Bort is telling his friends that their plan has completely failed before it has even started.
</Person1><Person2>Oh no. But what was their plan?
</Person2><Person1>Their idea was to start a rebellion on Anacreon. They wanted to help the people choose a new king, a king who would be a friend to the Foundation. But Bort says this is now impossible. And the reason… is Salvor Hardin himself.
</Person1><Person2>But Hardin is their leader! How could he be the reason their plan failed?
</Person2><Person1>Exactly! That is the mystery. Bort explains what he saw on Anacreon. He says the Foundation has established a religion there. A very powerful religion. And this religion teaches the people that their king is not just a man. He is a minor god.
</Person1><Person2>A god? You mean, like with special powers?
</Person2><Person1>Yes, that's just it. Bort says the Foundation uses its advanced science to create simple tricks that look like miracles. The king is surrounded by a glowing, radioactive light. He can float through the air. The people, and even the priests who help with the technology, believe these things are real. They believe the king has 'divine right' to rule.
</Person1><Person2>I think I need some help with that phrase, 'divine right'.
</Person2><Person1>Of course. 'Divine' means something that comes from a god. And 'right' is the power to do something. So, 'divine right' means the king's power to rule comes directly from a god. It doesn't come from the people. Because of this, the people of Anacreon would never, ever question their king. How can you fight a god?
</Person1><Person2>You can't. So their plan for a rebellion is truly a lost cause. I see now.
</Person2><Person1>It is. The men in the room are shocked and angry. They cannot understand Salvor Hardin's thinking. On one hand, he has given Anacreon powerful weapons. On the other hand, he has made their king so powerful that he is completely in control of his people. Why would Hardin do this? Why would he make his enemy stronger?
</Person1><Person2>It does seem crazy. What do they think is the reason?
</Person2><Person1>They don't know. One man, Walto, thinks Hardin is a traitor, that he is secretly working for Anacreon. But Sermak, their leader, doesn't believe that. He says Hardin is not a fool. There must be another reason, something they cannot see. The whole situation feels insane and meaningless to them.
</Person1><Person2>So they are stuck. They know Anacreon is preparing for war, but they don't know when it will happen. And they can't do anything to stop it.
</Person2><Person1>That’s right. Bort tells them that because the king is a god, he doesn't need to prepare his people for war with propaganda. He can just give the order, and they will fight. The attack could come tomorrow, for all they know.
</Person1><Person2>What a terrifying thought. To be completely powerless.
</Person2><Person1>It is. The chapter ends with this deep feeling of confusion and fear. Salvor Hardin, the man who is supposed to be protecting them, has created a situation that seems hopeless. The members of the Action Party are left in the dark, questioning their leader's mind and his loyalty.
</Person1><Person2>So, the big takeaway is that Hardin has a secret plan, but no one, not even his own people, understands it. And this plan has made their enemy incredibly strong.
</Person2><Person1>Precisely. And as they sit there in the snowy twilight, they have no idea that things are about to get even stranger. Because Salvor Hardin is getting ready to make a move himself. Next time, we will learn that Hardin is preparing to travel directly to Anacreon, right into the center of the danger. His own people will call him a traitor, and he will walk right into the court of the god-king he helped create. Thank you for joining us today.</Person1>
