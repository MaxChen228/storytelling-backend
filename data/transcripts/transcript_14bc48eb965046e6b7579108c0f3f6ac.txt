<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we followed Sazed on his journey. He found his people, the Terris, living in a surprising new village. And they called him… “Your Majesty.” What a shock! Today, we leave Sazed and find someone else in the story. Someone who is in terrible, terrible danger.
</Person1><Person1>Our chapter begins with the ash. You know, the ash that falls from the sky all the time in this world. But this ash is… different. It’s completely black. Not gray or partly white, like normal ash. Just black. It feels wrong. Unnatural.
</Person1><Person1>Now, I want you to imagine this. Picture yourself waking up in a dark room. You hear a voice shouting. “GET UP!” Everything is blurry. The voice shouts again. “Get up!” This is where we find our friend, Spook. He opens his eyes, but he can barely see. The world is just a dark, fuzzy shape.
</Person1><Person1>And he feels… numb. Like his body is dead. Why can't he feel anything? The voice is clear, but his thoughts are muddy, like walking through deep mud. He tries to think. What is wrong with him? He realizes his special power is gone. Spook is a Tineye. That means he can burn a metal called tin. When he burns tin, all of his senses—his sight, his hearing, his smell—become super strong.
</Person1><Person1>But now… the tin is gone. The little fire inside him is out. And the world feels so dull. So this is how other people live, he thinks. He can’t see the sharp lines of the room. The colors are not bright. His ears feel like they are full of cotton. He can’t even smell the wooden floor beneath him. He feels completely weak.
</Person1><Person1>Then, a sharp pain hits his shoulder. Oh, that's right. He remembers now. A sword. He was stabbed. He has lost a lot of blood. The voice tells him something else. “You’ll die soon, even if the flames don’t take you.” Flames? Spook looks and sees a light down a hallway. He finally understands. The house is on fire. And they are burning it down.
</Person1><Person1>This, finally, gives him the motivation to move. He tries to stand up, but his body is too weak. He just falls down again. The voice speaks to him. It’s a voice he feels he can trust. “Don’t walk,” the voice says. “Crawl.”
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… that’s an important word here. Crawl. To crawl means to move on your hands and knees. You know, like a baby moves before it can walk. Spook is so hurt and weak that he cannot stand. So, he must crawl to survive. It really shows us how much danger he is in.
</Person1><Person1>So Spook crawls. He follows the voice’s commands. Not toward the fire, but away from it. He crawls up the stairs, coughing from the smoke. He can feel the heat getting stronger. The fire is chasing him. At the top of the stairs, he is so tired. He falls against the wall and groans. He thinks he is going to die here. But the voice says again, “Get up!”
</Person1><Person1>Where has he heard that voice before? It feels so familiar. He trusts it, so he obeys. He gets back on his hands and knees. The voice tells him which room to go into. “Second room on the left,” it commands. He crawls inside. It’s a study, a room with a desk and books. But the fire is already here. The ceiling is burning. Black smoke is everywhere. Spook falls to the floor again. He knows there is no way out.
</Person1><Person1>As he lies there, he looks into the flames. He sees a shape. A person, standing in the middle of the fire. Just a dark shadow. Tall. Commanding. It feels… familiar. The voice shouts again. “Go to the desk!” Spook crawls to the desk. “Right drawer,” the voice says. He pulls the drawer open. Inside, he sees small glass bottles. Vials. The kind Allomancers use to carry their metals.
</Person1><Person1>He reaches for one, but his fingers are numb and don’t work well. He drops it, and it shatters on the floor. He tries again with another vial. He uses his teeth to open it, and he drinks. He searches inside himself, looking for the power of tin… but there is nothing. The vial was empty of tin. He cries out. How can he be saved now?
</Person1><Person1>You know, the story said that without his tin, everything for Spook seemed muted. That’s a lovely word. Muted means that sounds are very quiet and colors are not bright. It’s like turning the volume on your radio all the way down. Or turning the color on a television down until it’s almost black and white. That is how the world feels to Spook. Everything is quiet, dull, and far away.
</Person1><Person1>But the voice is not muted. It shouts, “Burn it!” Spook yells back, “There is no tin!” The voice explains. The man who owned this house was not a Tineye. He used a different metal. So Spook reaches inside himself again. And this time, he finds something he has never felt before. A new metal. A new power. He burns it.
</Person1><Person1>And suddenly… strength floods his body. His weak arms become steady. His fear disappears. He feels powerful. The voice says, “Stand!” This time, Spook leaps to his feet. He is not dizzy. He is not weak. He understands. Only one metal gives this kind of amazing physical strength. Spook is burning pewter. He is a Pewterarm.
</Person1><Person1>He looks at the figure in the flames. The person steps forward, out of the shadows. The fire lights up his face. And Spook sees who it is. He knows why he trusted that voice. It’s Kelsier. His old leader. The man who died a year ago. “I didn’t give you pewter just so you could live, Spook,” Kelsier says, pointing toward a way out. “I gave it to you so you could get revenge. Now, go!”
</Person1><Person1>What an incredible chapter. Spook was seconds from death, trapped and alone. But a ghost from his past, Kelsier, returned to give him a new life and a new power. Spook is no longer just a Tineye. He is now a Pewterarm, full of incredible strength. But Kelsier mentioned revenge. Revenge for what? It seems Spook has a new, mysterious mission.
</Person1><Person1>And our story is about to get even bigger. Next time, we will learn more about the mists that cover the world. They are changing, becoming dangerous… and they can now kill people. We will also meet a fascinating creature called a kandra. His name is TenSoon, and he is being held as a prisoner by his own people. He tried to warn them of a great danger, but they refused to listen. Now, a rebellion is growing among the younger kandra, and they want TenSoon to be their leader. I cannot wait to find out what happens. Until then, goodbye.</Person1>
