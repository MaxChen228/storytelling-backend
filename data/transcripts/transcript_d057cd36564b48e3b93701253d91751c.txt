Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings.
Last time, we left Vin and Elend with a very brave, and very crazy, plan. They decided to go to a ball inside the city they are trying to capture. But they are not the only ones with a difficult mission. Today, we follow another friend, Sazed, as he arrives at a different city, a city called Urteau.
First, I want you to imagine something. Imagine a world that does not change for one thousand years. The clothes people wear, the tools they use for farming, even the watches in their pockets… they all stay exactly the same. For a thousand years. This was the Lord Ruler’s empire. He built it to be perfect in his eyes, and then… he tried to stop time. He wanted nothing to change. Ever. And for a very, very long time… he was successful. Everything stayed the same. Until, of course, it all fell apart.
Now, the Lord Ruler is gone. And Sazed is traveling to the city of Urteau. Can you picture it with me? Ash falls from the sky, like a soft, gray snow. The city is large and very old. But it has no walls to protect it. The Lord Ruler did not allow cities to build walls. Mmm… Sazed always thought that was interesting. It was like a secret sign. It showed that the Lord Ruler was maybe… a little bit afraid. If he worried about cities that could fight against him, then maybe he knew a secret. He knew that he could be defeated. Thoughts like that are what led Sazed to join the rebellion.
So, here is Sazed, arriving at Urteau. A city that finally rebelled. But there is a problem. The people of Urteau hate all nobles. And to them, Elend is just another noble.
Sazed is riding in a carriage now. With him are his friends, Breeze and Allrianne. A soldier, Captain Goradel, walks beside the carriage. He looks worried. He tells Sazed, “I don’t like this, Master Keeper.” He has heard that Urteau is a brutal place. He says, “I don’t think you’ll be safe.”
Sazed tries to calm him. But Captain Goradel is still worried. He asks, “What if they take you captive?”
Then Breeze leans forward. Breeze can be… well, he can be very direct. He says that this is why kings send ambassadors. If an ambassador is captured, the king is still safe. Then he says something quite sad. He says to the soldier, “We, my friend, are something Elend can never be: expendable.”
Mmm… expendable. That’s our word for today. Expendable means that something is not important to keep. You can lose it, and it is okay. It’s like a paper cup. You use it once, and then you throw it away. Breeze is saying that to the king, they are like paper cups. They can be lost. The soldier, Goradel, does not like this idea at all. He says, “I don’t feel very expendable.” (soft laugh) I don’t think anyone does.
So, Sazed is on a dangerous mission. He is an ambassador for his king, but he has been told he is not important. He can be lost. That must be a very heavy feeling.
As they get closer, Sazed looks out the window. The road goes down, into a big, empty ditch. Allrianne looks out too. She asks, “Why’d they build their roads in ditches?” Breeze explains that they used to be canals, filled with water. But now they are all dry. Allrianne thinks it’s creepy. She says it makes the buildings look twice as tall. Can you see that? The carriage is low, in an empty canal, and the buildings rise up high on both sides. It must feel like the city is watching you.
Finally, they enter the city. They have two hundred soldiers with them, marching in formation. They are met by another group of soldiers, wearing brown uniforms. Sazed had sent a message before they arrived. So the new leader of Urteau is expecting them. This leader is not called a king. He is called… The Citizen.
Captain Goradel comes back to the carriage with a message. The Citizen wants to meet with Sazed immediately. Breeze remarks, “The man doesn’t waste time, does he?” Sazed just nods. He says, “We’ll go, then.”
So, Sazed has arrived in this strange, wall-less city with a new, mysterious leader. He is here to talk about peace, but the city feels tense and unwelcoming. He is an ambassador, but his own friend has called him expendable. What kind of leader is this “Citizen”? And will he listen to Sazed’s message?
Next time, we will find out. Sazed will meet the Citizen face-to-face. And he will discover that this new leader loves the memory of Kelsier… but sees Emperor Elend as just another evil tyrant. It is going to be a very, very difficult conversation.
Thank you for listening. Until next time.</Person1>
