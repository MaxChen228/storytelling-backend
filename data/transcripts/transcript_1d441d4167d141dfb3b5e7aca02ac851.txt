<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left Elend and his small army in a terrible fight. The koloss were winning. But just as things looked hopeless, Elend pointed to the sky. Help was finally arriving.
</Person1><Person1>And then… she came. Vin fell from the sky. Can you picture that? She landed in a storm of metal horseshoes, right in the center of the koloss army. She did not hesitate. She immediately used her special power, her Allomancy. She Pushed two horseshoes toward a koloss. One hit the creature in the head, and it fell back. The other flew over its head and hit another koloss behind it.
</Person1><Person1>Vin moved like a dancer. She spun and threw another horseshoe. She was so fast, so precise. She then flared iron, which means she used her power to Pull metal. The horseshoe flew back to her. But on its way, it wrapped around the wrist of a very large koloss. Her Pull sent her flying toward the giant beast… but it also made the creature lose its balance. Mmm… she uses her small size as a weapon, you know? The koloss’s huge iron sword fell to the ground. Vin hit the creature in the chest and then Pushed off its fallen sword. This sent her flying upward in a backward flip.
</Person1><Person1>She flew about fifteen feet into the air. Another koloss swung its massive sword at her, but it missed. Instead, its sword cut off the head of the koloss standing right below Vin. The creature who swung the sword… it didn't seem to mind that it had killed its comrade. It just looked up at Vin with its blood-red, hateful eyes. Vin then Pulled on the sword that had fallen. It shot up toward her, but its weight also pulled her down. She caught it as she fell. The sword was almost as tall as she was! But her power, her pewter, gave her the strength to hold it easily. As she landed, she cut off the attacking koloss’s arm. Then she cut its legs. She left it there to die and turned to her next enemies.
</Person1><Person1>It’s interesting… the koloss always seemed fascinated by Vin. They were also very angry and confused by her. For them, big size means danger. They could not understand how this small woman—barely over five feet tall—could be such a threat. But they saw her kill, and that drew them to her. And Vin was okay with that. She wanted them to come to her. She screamed as she fought. The battlefield was too quiet, because when koloss enter their killing frenzy, they stop yelling. They only focus on killing.
</Person1><Person1>The story tells us something very important about Vin now. She is not fighting because she is angry. She is not fighting because she is afraid. She has grown beyond those feelings. She once held Elend in her arms as he died. And yet… he is alive now. She understands that every breath he takes is a gift. She has found a kind of peace. She knows she cannot keep him safe by hiding him. He is a leader. He has to risk his life. So, she no longer fights just to protect him. No. She fights with an understanding. She is a knife. She is Elend’s knife. She protects the world he is trying to build, and the people he works so hard to defend. This peace… this peace is what gives her strength.
</Person1><Person1>Koloss died all around her. There were ten thousand of them in this army. That is… an incredible number. Far too many for her to kill all by herself. But she didn't need to. She just had to do one thing. She had to make them afraid. Because koloss, under all their rage, can feel fear. She could see it starting to build in the creatures around her.
</Person1><Person1>Then, she saw him. A massive koloss, pushing through the army toward her. Perfect, she thought. It was the biggest one she had ever seen, maybe thirteen feet tall. It was so big its own heart should have killed it. It bellowed, and the sound echoed across the strange, quiet battlefield. Vin smiled. Then she burned duralumin. This is a special metal. When you burn it with another metal, it makes that second metal explode with power, all at once. She burned duralumin with steel. WHOOSH! She Pushed outward in every direction. It was like a giant wave of force. The swords of the koloss were ripped from their hands. Their massive bodies were thrown backward, scattered like ash in the wind.
</Person1><Person1>She quickly drank a vial to get her metals back. Then she leaped toward the giant creature. A smaller koloss tried to stop her, but she broke its arm and took its sword. The huge, thirteen-foot-tall beast attacked. It swung a sword so large it made the air roar. Now, Vin could not parry this attack. To parry is a special word for fighting. It means to block another person's sword with your own sword. But this creature’s weapon was just too big. So, Vin did something clever. She pushed her own sword into the earth, point-first. The giant's sword slammed into her blade, which was held strong by the ground. The metal shook in her hands, but it held.
</Person1><Person1>Her fingers were stinging, but she let go of her sword and jumped. She landed on the crossguard of her own sword and then leaped off it, high into the air. The koloss looked surprised again. This small woman was now thirteen feet in the air, her leg pulled back. She kicked the koloss directly in the side of its head. CRACK. The skull broke. The giant creature’s eyes rolled back, and it collapsed. It was dead. From a single kick.
</Person1><Person1>Vin landed softly on the dead monster’s chest. And all around her… the koloss froze. Even in their blood frenzy, they were shocked. They saw her drop their biggest warrior. Perhaps their minds were too slow. Or perhaps, with their fear, they could also feel… caution. She had their attention now. She had made them afraid.
</Person1><Person1>Vin has planted a seed of fear in this army. But what will she do with that fear? And what will happen when a new, even more terrifying enemy arrives? We'll find out next time, as a Steel Inquisitor descends on the battlefield. I hope you’ll join me for the next part of our story. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
