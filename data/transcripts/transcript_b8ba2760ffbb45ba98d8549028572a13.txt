<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Mayor Hardin meeting with Ambassador Verisof, who returned secretly from Anacreon with urgent news. Now, the two men are talking, and the fate of the Foundation hangs in the balance.
</Person1><Person2>The mayor looks at his ambassador and gets right to the point. "Start talking," he says. "What is the situation at Anacreon?"
</Person2><Person1>You can almost feel the tension in the room. The ambassador, Verisof, frowns. He takes the cigar from his mouth and puts it down, as if he's lost his taste for it. "Well," he says, "it's pretty bad."
</Person1><Person2>Hardin isn't surprised. He knows Verisof would only return if the danger was real. The problem, Verisof explains, is a man named Prince Regent Wienis. He is the uncle of the young king, Lepold, and he is the true power on Anacreon.
</Person2><Person1>And this Wienis… he sounds like a real piece of work. Hardin remembers him from years ago. A dark young man with a squint in his eye and a hooked nose. Verisof confirms it's the same man, just with gray hair now. He says Wienis "plays the game dirty."
</Person1><Person2>Mmm, not only that, but he's also described as an "egregious fool." That's a funny combination, isn't it? He's foolish, but he thinks he's a "shrewd devil," which means he thinks he's very clever. This makes his mistakes even bigger and more obvious.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly! Verisof uses a great metaphor. He says Wienis's idea of cracking an egg is to shoot a nuclear blast at it. In other words, he uses way too much force for small problems. He has unlimited self-confidence and is, as Verisof puts it, "foaming at the mouth" with eagerness to attack the Foundation.
</Person1><Person2>Let's pause on that phrase for a moment. "Foaming at the mouth." It's a powerful image. It means to be extremely angry or excited, like a wild animal. It tells us that Wienis isn't just considering an attack; he desperately wants one.
</Person2><Person1>And now, he has a reason. Or at least, he thinks he does. Verisof tells Hardin about a huge, old warship they found. A battle cruiser from the old Empire, just drifting in space. It's in very good condition. Too good.
</Person1><Person2>Wienis wants this ship. And he has demanded that the Foundation—with all its scientific knowledge—repair it for him. He even claims that a note from Hardin about the ship proves the Foundation plans to attack him. It's a clear trap.
</Person2><Person1>If Hardin refuses, Wienis will say his suspicions are confirmed and he must attack in "self-defense." If Hardin agrees… well, he’s giving an incredibly powerful weapon to his biggest enemy. What would you do? It seems like an impossible choice.
</Person1><Person2>But Hardin… he just laughs. A soft, gentle laugh. He tells Verisof to do it. "Have the ship fixed up," he says, "and present it with my compliments." He even suggests they rename it the Wienis! Can you imagine?
</Person2><Person1>Verisof is stunned. He understands the logic, maybe. Anacreon's current navy is already strong enough to defeat them. So what's one more ship? But still… this ship is different. It's a monster. It has weapons that can blow up a planet. He's worried.
</Person1><Person2>And he's not just worried about Anacreon. He brings up the political problems back home on Terminus. A new political party is attacking Hardin, and they are getting stronger. Verisof fears they might try to take power without an election. He tells Hardin to do something now! Either tell the Council the plan, or force a fight with Anacreon before they get the new ship.
</Person2><Person1>But Hardin refuses. He says the crisis hasn't come yet. This brings us to the core of everything: Hari Seldon's Plan. Verisof questions it. He says, "I just don't see how it could be possible to chart history for a thousand years ahead." He wonders if Seldon made a mistake.
</Person1><Person2>Hardin is firm. He says the Plan is real. And he reveals a key rule from Seldon himself. At each crisis, their freedom of action would become so small that only one course of action was possible.
</Person2><Person1>Think about that. It's like walking down a path that gets narrower and narrower, until you can only go straight ahead. Hardin says that because they still have a choice—to fix the ship or not—it means the true crisis isn't here yet. They must wait. They must let things drift.
</Person1><Person2>This is where we hear another great word. When Hardin says Verisof wouldn't be here unless things were bad, Verisof replies with a single word: "Scarcely." This just means 'almost not' or 'only just.' It's a very efficient way of saying, "Yes, that is the only reason I am here."
</Person2><Person1>So the takeaway is this powerful idea of trust versus fear. Verisof sees the immediate danger and wants to act. Hardin sees the long path of history and believes they must have patience and trust the Plan. But even Hardin has a worry. He admits he's afraid. Not of Wienis, but of the fact that he told Verisof and a few others about the Plan. He says, "I'm damned afraid that it was Seldon's idea to have no one know."
</Person1><Person2>What a chilling thought. If people know the future, their actions might change it, breaking the very plan designed to save them. Hardin's knowledge might be the most dangerous weapon of all.
</Person2><Person1>And that is where we leave them. The order has been given to repair the ship. The crisis is now officially on its way. Next time, we will learn more about why the Plan needs people to be blind. And we will finally go to Anacreon, where the foolish young King Lepold meets with his manipulative uncle, Wienis, as their new warship is being prepared. The board is set, and the pieces are moving.
