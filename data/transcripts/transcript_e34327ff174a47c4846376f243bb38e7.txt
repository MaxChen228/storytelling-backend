Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Mayor Hardin and the Board of Trustees in a dark room, waiting. A hologram of the great scientist Hari Seldon appeared and told them a shocking secret: the Encyclopedia they worked on for fifty years… was a fraud.
Now, let's listen to what Seldon says next. Picture the room. The only light comes from the glowing image of Seldon in his wheelchair. He looks calm, but his words are world-changing. He tells them, "We placed you on this planet, at this time, for a reason." He explains that for fifty years, their lives were guided. Now, they have no freedom of action. Their future path is already chosen. It is… inevitable.
Mmm… that’s our first word for today: inevitable. Inevitable means something is certain to happen. You cannot stop it. Think of the sun rising tomorrow. It is inevitable. Seldon says their future is like that. They will face many problems, or crises. And each crisis will force them to follow one single path.
Why? Seldon explains that the huge Galactic Empire is falling. It has been getting weaker for centuries. And after it falls completely, there will be thirty thousand years of darkness and barbarism. A time without science, without order. Can you imagine that? Thirty thousand years! But, Seldon says, we can make this dark time shorter. We can change thirty thousand years to just one thousand years. And Terminus… Terminus is the key.
He tells them that Terminus, and another Foundation at the other end of the galaxy, are the seeds for a new, Second Galactic Empire. But he cannot tell them how. If they know the details of the plan, their knowledge might change their actions. And if their actions change, the plan could fail. That’s why there were no psychologists on Terminus. No one who could discover the plan too early.
Seldon then describes their first crisis. He says, "You are a small world of scientists." You are surrounded by powerful neighbors who are falling into barbarism. You have nuclear power, which is amazing! But you don’t have metals. You are helpless. Action is forced on you. And the solution, Seldon says with a little smile… is obvious!
Then, the hologram of Hari Seldon looks down at his book. And just like that, he disappears. The lights in the Vault turn back on.
Everyone is silent. The chairman of the Board, Pirenne, looks at Hardin. His eyes are sad. He says, "You were right." He asks Hardin to meet with the Board to decide what to do next. One by one, the powerful men shake Hardin’s hand. They are scientists, and they can admit when they are wrong. Hardin smiles to himself. He knows it is too late for them. As they were watching the hologram, Hardin’s friend, Yohan Lee, was taking control of the planet. The Board of Trustees has no more power. The coup is over.
Hardin isn't worried about the Anacreonians who are arriving tomorrow. He knows they won’t be a problem for long. Because just as Hari Seldon said, the solution to this first crisis is obvious.
And now… the story jumps forward. Thirty years have passed.
Salvor Hardin is older now, sixty-two. He is the Mayor of Terminus. The world has changed so much. The great Galactic Empire is just a memory. Now, there are only the Four Kingdoms nearby. These were once small parts of the Empire, but now they are fighting little wars with their own kings. Science is becoming mythology for them. Only Terminus, the Foundation, remembers.
Hardin is in his office with his old friend, Yohan Lee. They are waiting for a visit. A deputation. A deputation is a small group of people sent to speak for a larger group. In this case, it’s a group of young politicians who are unhappy with Hardin.
Lee wants to be tough with them. He says, "Give them the brush-off," which means, "don't give them your time." But Hardin is calmer, more clever. He tells Lee, "You've never learned the gentle art of sneaking up from behind." Hardin prefers to be smart and careful, not loud and forceful. He has invited the men into his private office. He says flattery is useful with young people.
Lee warns him that the leader of the group, a man named Sermak, is dangerous. He has a lot of followers. Lee even says Hardin should arrest him! But Hardin just smiles. The door opens, and four young men walk in. Hardin offers them cigars from a beautiful silver box. It’s a calm, polite beginning to what will be a very difficult conversation.
So, the first crisis is over. Hardin has led Terminus for thirty successful years. But now, a new challenge is here. It’s not from outside enemies with spaceships. This challenge is from the inside, from young, ambitious people who think they know better.
What will this man Sermak say? He believes Hardin is weak. He wants to fight. Hardin believes violence is the last refuge of the incompetent. A political storm is coming to Terminus. I can't wait to see how the clever Salvor Hardin handles this new crisis. We’ll find out next time. Goodbye for now.
