<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. When we last left our master trader, Hober Mallow, he had just charmed the Commdor of Korell with the promise of immense riches, sidestepping the Foundation’s usual religious angle. But as you’ll recall, the Commdor’s wife, the Commdora, was far from impressed, and that’s precisely where our story picks up today, in the middle of a… very tense conversation.
</Person1><Person1>The Commdor has just told his wife that their dinner with Mallow will be on the "most lavish scale," and her response is pure ice. "Oh, I see," she says, staring at him contemptuously. Can you just picture that look? Mmm… let’s pause on that word for a moment. Contemptuously. It means to look at someone with a mix of disgust and disrespect, as if they are utterly worthless. And that is exactly the energy she’s directing at her husband.
</Person1><Person1>She accuses him of plotting with these "barbarians" against her father. She calls his soul "little" and "weazened"—which means wrinkled and shrunken, as if with old age. She sees herself as a victim, sacrificed in an "unsavory marriage" for political reasons, claiming she could have found a better man in the mud. The bitterness is just pouring out of her. But the Commdor’s reply… it’s chilling. He doesn’t shout. He speaks calmly, almost conversationally. He suggests maybe she’d enjoy returning to her home world. And then he adds, with this awful, calculating tone, that he might just keep her tongue as a souvenir. And her ears. And the tip of her nose. The cruelty is breathtaking, isn't it? He threatens to mutilate her, to destroy her beauty and her ability to speak out against him.
</Person1><Person1>She fires back, calling him a "little pug-dog" and threatening him with her father's power. But the Commdor has a final, brilliant move. He ends the argument not with more threats, but with a gift. He says, "Here, take this, then, and keep still." And he fastens one of Mallow’s glowing, luminescent necklaces around her neck and a belt around her waist. He pushes the knob himself. And the effect is instantaneous. The Commdora gasps. She holds out her hands stiffly, touching the jewelry as if she can’t believe it’s real. And then… silence. The text tells us, simply: "The Commdora kept still." In a single move, he has bought her silence with the very technology he plans to profit from. It’s a powerful, and rather bleak, moment about human nature, don't you think?
</Person1><Person1>Meanwhile, Hober Mallow is having his own doubts. His crewman, Jaim Twer, can see something is bothering him. Mallow explains that he feels like he’s throwing his full weight against a door, only to find it was already unlocked, or "ajar." He says, "We're getting into this steel foundry too easily." He doesn't think it's a trap, exactly, but he suspects the easy access means there will be nothing important to see. They're being shown what the Commdor wants them to see. He worries that Korell might already have nuclear power, but is hiding it, applying it only to a war economy. If they don't find any evidence of it in the foundry, it could mean anything. As he says, "Toss a coin or take a guess."
</Person1><Person1>And so they go to the foundry. The place has an "odor of decay," old and quiet. And here, Mallow puts on a show. He becomes a magician, a salesman of miracles. He takes a nuclear shear and, with a swift motion, slices a sheet of thick steel in two as if it were paper. The court officials jump back in shock. He then demonstrates how it can shave off chunks of steel, a process he calls "whittling—with steel." He shows them a plane that shaves off transparently thin foils of metal, and a drill that punches clean holes through an inch of hard steel with a simple touch. The crowd is mesmerized. They’re whispering, tiptoeing over each other to get a better look. The text describes it as a "sleight-of-hand show," a "vaudeville act." It's high-pressure salesmanship at its most dazzling.
</Person1><Person1>And that brings us to another great vocabulary word: legerdemain. The story says that after his demonstration, "There was no need of further legerdemain." Legerdemain means clever trickery or sleight of hand, the kind a stage magician uses. Mallow’s demonstration was so effective, so seemingly magical, that he didn't need any more tricks. His audience was already sold.
</Person1><Person1>But it's in this moment of triumph, as he's performing his final trick of seamlessly joining two pipes into one, that everything changes. Mallow looks up at his audience and freezes. In the excitement, the Commdor's personal bodyguards have pushed to the front. And for the first time, Mallow gets a clear look at their weapons. They are nuclear. But that’s not the shocking part. The truly staggering discovery is the symbol etched in worn gold on the butts of their guns. It’s a Spaceship-and-Sun. The very same symbol of the old Galactic Empire. The Empire. The empire that was supposed to be gone, a thing of history. It’s still out there. And it’s re-emerging, right here on the edge of the galaxy.
</Person1><Person1>This single observation changes everything. Mallow finishes his demonstration on autopilot, his mind racing. He has what he came for, but he’s found something infinitely more important, and more dangerous. The game is no longer about trade deals and profits. It's about the return of a galactic superpower. And as this realization dawns on him… Mallow smiles.
</Person1><Person1>The story then jumps forward. Mallow’s ship is two days out in space. He gives his second-in-command a set of secret orders. The lieutenant is to take the ship to a hidden planet and wait for two months. If Mallow doesn't return, a special Time Capsule is to be delivered to the Foundation as his final report. And with that, Mallow boards a small lifeboat and disappears into space, alone. He’s on a new mission, a secret one, prompted by that single, golden symbol.
</Person1><Person1>And where is he going? Our chapter ends with a tantalizing clue. We are introduced to an old man named Onum Barr, a former noble living in ruin, who has lost everything and fears nothing. He looks up to see an intruder in his home. We can guess who that intruder is. Mallow has sought out this old man for a reason. Barr is a living piece of the history Mallow has just discovered. He holds the story of the Empire’s return, a story of rebellion, ruin, and a viceroy who is a murderer. What secrets will this old man share, and how will Mallow use them? We are left on the edge of our seats, waiting to see what our master trader will do now that he’s a player in a much, much larger game. We'll have to discover that together next time.</Person1>
