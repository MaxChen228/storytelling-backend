<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Hari Seldon and Gaal Dornick accepted exile to a distant planet called Terminus. To Gaal, it felt like a terrible defeat. But as they travel back to the University, Gaal is about to learn that Seldon's plan is much bigger than he ever imagined.
</Person1><Person2>I'm so curious to see what happens. Gaal must be feeling so confused and worried right now.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. Imagine them sitting in that taxi. It’s quiet as it moves through hundreds of miles of tunnels deep under the city. The only sound is the whine of the engine. For a long, long time, they don't speak.
</Person1><Person2>That silence must be heavy. After everything that happened with the Commission...
</Person2><Person1>It is. Finally, Gaal breaks the silence. He asks Seldon, "Was it true? What you told the Commissioner? Would your death really have made the Fall happen faster?"
</Person1><Person2>That's the big question, isn't it? Was Seldon just bluffing to save his own life?
</Person2><Person1>Seldon's answer is very clear. "I never lie about psychohistory," he says. He explains that Commissioner Chen is a very clever politician. And politicians, he says, have a special ability. They have an instinctive feeling for the truths of psychohistory. They can feel when it's real.
</Person1><Person2>An instinctive feeling… what does that mean, exactly?
</Person2><Person1>Mmm, that's a great question. An 'instinctive feeling' is when you know something is true deep inside yourself, without needing someone to prove it. It's like a gut feeling. Chen didn't need to see Seldon's math; he just knew Seldon was telling the truth.
</Person1><Person2>I see. So Chen knew the threat was real. But then Gaal must be wondering… if Seldon was right, why did he agree to be sent away?
</Person2><Person1>He asks that exact question. But Seldon… he doesn't answer. And just then, the taxi bursts out of the tunnels and into the light. And Gaal is just… stunned. He had almost forgotten that a sun could exist.
</Person1><Person2>Wow. He must have been inside the metal city of Trantor for so long. What does he see?
</Person2><Person1>The University buildings are not the hard, steel-gray of the rest of the city. They are silvery, almost the color of ivory. It’s beautiful. But then Gaal looks down… and he sees soldiers.
</Person1><Person2>Soldiers? At the University?
</Person2><Person1>Yes. A captain comes to meet them. He tells Seldon that he and all his people are now under martial law.
</Person1><Person2>Uh oh. What is 'martial law'?
</Person2><Person1>That's another important phrase. 'Martial law' is when the army is in control of a place, not the regular government or police. The soldiers make all the rules. It means Seldon and his followers are no longer free.
</Person1><Person2>That sounds serious. What else does the captain say?
</Person2><Person1>He gives them some shocking news. He says, "You have six months to prepare to leave for Terminus."
</Person1><Person2>Six months? That's it? To get thousands of families ready to move to a new planet? That seems impossible!
</Person2><Person1>Gaal thinks so too! He shouts, "Six months! This is just slower murder!" But Seldon puts a hand on his arm, telling him to be quiet. They go to Seldon's office.
</Person1><Person2>I can't believe how calm Seldon is.
</Person2><Person1>And inside his office, we find out why. The office is completely spy-proof. And Seldon finally looks at Gaal and says, "Now. Six months will be enough."
</Person1><Person2>How can it be enough? What is Gaal missing?
</Person2><Person1>Seldon explains that everything that happened—the trial, the arguments, Chen’s decision—was planned. He says they studied Chen so carefully, they knew exactly how he would act. The entire trial was designed to have only one ending.
</Person1><Person2>Wait… are you saying Seldon wanted to be exiled?
</Person2><Person1>Exactly! To prove it, Seldon touches a secret spot on his desk. A part of the wall slides open. He gives Gaal a small microfilm. When Gaal looks at it, he is in complete shock.
</Person1><Person2>What's on it?
</Person2><Person1>Plans. Preparations for the move to Terminus. They have been preparing for two and a half years.
</Person1><Person2>No way! So this whole time… it was all an act?
</Person2><Person1>It was all part of the plan. Gaal asks why. Why go through all this trouble just to be sent away? Seldon gives him a few reasons. First, it was the only way to get twenty thousand families to agree to move to the very edge of the galaxy.
</Person1><Person2>That makes sense. People wouldn't just leave their homes willingly.
</Person2><Person1>Right. And second, on Terminus, they can get support from the Empire without the Empire worrying that they are a threat. But then… Seldon reveals something even bigger.
</Person1><Person2>There's more?
</Person2><Person1>Oh, yes. He tells Gaal that they are building a safe place for science on Terminus. And… another one, at the other end of the galaxy. A place he calls "Star's End."
</Person1><Person2>Two foundations? Not one?
</Person2><Person1>Two. And then comes the final, saddest secret. Seldon tells Gaal that he is very sick. The doctors say he will die in a year or two.
</Person1><Person2>Oh, no. After all this work, he won't get to see it happen.
</Person2><Person1>He says he is at peace with it. He has done what he wanted to do with his life. He tells Gaal that others, maybe even Gaal himself, will be his successors. They will finish the plan. And then, in a soft whisper, Seldon says, "I am finished."
</Person1><Person2>Wow. So Seldon wasn't defeated at all. He was the one in control the entire time. Every single move was planned.
</Person2><Person1>That's the big takeaway. His life's work is complete. But for the thousands of people heading to the lonely planet of Terminus, their story is just beginning.
</Person1><Person2>So what happens next? Do we get to see Terminus?
</Person2><Person1>We do. Next time, we will jump forward in time. A new generation has been born on Terminus. But the galaxy around them is changing, and a new danger is rising. A mayor named Salvor Hardin sees the threat, but will the scientists who lead the planet listen to him? Join us next time to find out! Goodbye for now!</Person1>
