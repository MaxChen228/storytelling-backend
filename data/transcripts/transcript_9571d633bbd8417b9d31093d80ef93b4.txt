<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, Vin discovered something very important. The dark power she is fighting has rules, just like a game. She realized that to win, she must first learn these rules. Now, she is with Elend on their boat, and a new part of the puzzle is about to begin.
Imagine them there, together. They are on a narrowboat, moving slowly through dark water. The air is probably cold. Elend is the king now, and he looks different. His arms are strong and muscular, not like the scholar he used to be. Vin walks to him and puts a hand on his arm. He sighs, and pulls her close to him.
She can feel he is worried. “What are you thinking about?” she asks. Elend looks out at the other boats and the soldiers. He tells her he is worried he is becoming like the Lord Ruler. The evil king they fought so hard to defeat.
Why would he think that? Well, he made a very difficult choice. He let his own soldiers get sick in the mists. He did this to help them become Allomancers, to make them stronger. He knows it was necessary for their army. But it feels wrong. “It’s still ruthless,” he says. He feels brutal.
He thinks about all the hard choices a king must make. He is marching to another city to take it. He says he is doing it for the greater good. But he knows that bad kings, tyrants, have always used that excuse. Mmm… it's a difficult position to be in, isn't it? He wanted to be a king who protects people, not one who attacks them. But he sees no other way.
Then, he tells Vin about a terrible secret from his childhood. He talks about how noble families found Allomancers among their children. The children were beaten. Beaten so badly they were close to death. This painful experience was called Snapping. It was the only way to awaken their secret powers.
Vin shivers. It sounds awful. Elend remembers his own beating very clearly. He says his father didn't do it, but he stood and watched. And for Elend, the beating was for nothing. He did not Snap. He did not become an Allomancer. He was just a boy who was hurt by his own family.
When Elend became king, one of the first things he did was stop this. He made a new law. No more beating children. But now… now he is not so sure it was the right thing to do. “And if those beatings could save lives?” he asks Vin. Their kingdom needs more Allomancers to be safe. He is starting to understand the Lord Ruler. He sees that some of the old king’s choices were not simply evil. They were effective. They kept order.
This brings us to a very important word in our story. The word is consequence. A consequence is what happens because of an action. It is the result. If you push something, the consequence is that it moves. Elend is worried about the consequences of his actions. He worries they are making him a bad person.
And Vin… Vin is also thinking about consequences. For her, it’s a rule of the world. Every action has a reaction. Every Push has a Pull. She thinks this is the key to fighting the dark force. It is the first rule she needs to understand.
Vin looks up at Elend. She can see the worry in his eyes, but she also sees his strength. “I don’t like this hardness in you, Elend,” she tells him. She is honest with him.
He knows she is right. He looks at her and says he can only be king because he knows what is right. He was willing to give up his throne for it once. He asks her for a promise. “If I ever lose that, Vin, you need to tell me. All right?” He needs her to be his guide.
He knows they must find a balance. A balance between the good people they want to be, and the strong leaders they need to be. As they are talking, a small boat comes up beside theirs. A man in simple brown robes steps onto their deck. He wears large glasses and has a happy smile. This is Noorden, a scholar. He was an obligator, one of the Lord Ruler's officials, but he is a good man. He is here to give Elend a report. He has brought books and papers, full of numbers. He has counted all the soldiers who got sick from the mists.
And the numbers he is about to share… are very, very strange. They are a new clue. A new consequence that Vin and Elend do not yet understand.
That’s where we will leave the story for today. Noorden has arrived with his report, and the numbers he shares will change everything. What could they possibly mean? We will find out next time. Thank you for listening to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide. Goodbye for now. </Person1>
