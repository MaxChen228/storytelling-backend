<Person1>Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host. Last time, we left our master trader, Hober Mallow, in a very tight spot. He was facing a fiercely loyal tech-man on the planet Siwenna, a man who had just accused him of bribery and was threatening to call the authorities. It seemed like Mallow’s mission to get access to their nuclear technology was about to fail spectacularly. But with Mallow… things are never quite what they seem.
</Person1><Person2>So, as this tech-man is delivering his grand, angry speech, full of pride for his guild and loyalty to the Empire, Mallow is just… smiling to himself. He sees the whole performance as patently artificial—which means it’s obviously fake, completely insincere. The man’s so-called dignified anger just feels like a bad play.
</Person2><Person1>Mmm, exactly. And Mallow, with this almost humorous look, glances at the man’s hands and calmly says, “Your Wisdom, you are wrong on three counts.” He explains he’s not a spy for the viceroy. Then he delivers the hook. He says his gift is something the Emperor himself, in all his glory, will never possess. And what he wants in return is tiny… a “mere breath.”
</Person1><Person2>The tech-man, of course, just scoffs. He’s deep in sarcasm, mocking Mallow’s “godlike power.” But Mallow doesn’t argue. He just stands up and makes the most incredible, most audacious request. He points to the blaster on the tech-man’s desk and says, “If you will just draw that blaster… and shoot me, I will be obliged.”
</Person2><Person1>Can you just imagine the shock in that room? Mallow lays out the terms: if he dies, the tech-man can be a hero. But if he doesn’t die, the tech-man gets to keep his gift. And for the first time, the tech-man notices it—a faint, pearly white glow around Mallow. He raises his blaster, full of suspicion and wonder… and he fires.
</Person1><Person2>And the text describes it so vividly. A blinding line of energy strikes at Mallow’s heart… and just… splashes. It splashes against that pearly light and dies in mid-air. The tech-man’s blaster just drops to the floor. He’s stunned. Mallow, completely calm, simply asks, “Does the Emperor have a personal force-shield? You can have one.”
</Person2><Person1>The bribe has been made, and it’s irresistible. The tech-man stutters, asking if Mallow is a tech-man himself. “No,” Mallow says. He’s being what the book calls coolly contemptuous—he’s showing this calm, almost arrogant disrespect. He knows he has all the power now. He tosses a small, knobbed chain onto the desk and says, “There it is.”
</Person1><Person2>The tech-man is still skeptical, especially about the power source. He’s a senior tech-man, trained at the best university. He can’t believe that a tiny container, the size of a walnut, could possibly hold a nuclear generator. He threatens to report Mallow for being a charlatan, a fraud.
</Person2><Person1>But Mallow just challenges him: “Explain it yourself then, if you can.” So the tech-man, nervously, puts on the device. He turns it on, and the same radiant shield surrounds him. He fires his blaster at his own hand… and the fire just dashes against it, completely harmlessly. The technology is real.
</Person1><Person2>For a moment, greed takes over. The tech-man whirls around and asks, “And what if I shoot you now, and keep the shield?” But Mallow was one step ahead. A shield instantly appears around him, too. “Do you think I gave you my only sample?” he asks. The game is over. The tech-man’s blaster clatters onto the desk. He’s been completely outplayed.
</Person2><Person1>Defeated, he finally asks what Mallow wants in return. And Mallow’s request is so simple, so strange. “I want to see your generators.” Not to touch them, not to learn their secrets, just to see them from a distance. The tech-man, trapped, agrees. He leads Mallow through an underground passage into the silent, ozone-filled powerhouse.
</Person1><Person2>For fifteen minutes, Mallow just… watches. His eyes miss nothing, but his fingers touch nothing. Finally, he asks the crucial questions. He asks if the tech-men keep the generators running. “Yes.” He asks if they can repair them if they break down. And this is where the tech-man’s pride becomes his undoing. He gets indignant. “They don’t break down,” he insists. “They were built for eternity.”
</Person2><Person1>Mallow pushes him. What if he, Mallow, were to blast a vital part? Could they fix it? The tech-man explodes in fury, howling that Mallow has gotten what he asked for and should get out. And that’s it. That’s all Mallow needed to hear. He has his answer. The great, powerful Siwenna… can maintain their technology, but they can no longer repair or build it. They’ve lost the knowledge. Their power is a hollow shell.
</Person1><Person2>Mallow leaves, and two days later, the force-shield he gave the tech-man goes dead. A final, perfect little twist. Mallow didn’t just bribe him; he gave him a temporary tool to get exactly what he needed, and then it was gone.
</Person2><Person1>The story then jumps forward. Mallow is back on his home planet, Terminus, relaxing in a sunroom. But he’s not resting. He’s already planning his next conquest, and this time, it’s political. He’s talking to a man named Ankor Jael, an experienced politician, and Mallow declares, “I’d rather rest in a council seat. Because I’m going to have that seat, and you’re going to help me.”
</Person1><Person2>Jael is doubtful. Mallow is an outsider, a Smyrnian, and he’ll be up against the shrewdest politician on the planet, Jorane Sutt. But Mallow is confident. He has money, a lot of it, and a plan. Just as they are discussing this, who should arrive early for a meeting? Jorane Sutt himself.
</Person2><Person1>Mmm, the timing is perfect, isn't it? Mallow quickly hides Jael in the next room with a speaker so he can listen in. Sutt enters, stiff and serious, and he gets right to the point. He wants to know Mallow’s terms. He wants to know what Mallow was really doing on his trading missions. The political battle has begun.
</Person1><Person2>So Mallow has successfully uncovered the fatal weakness of a powerful planet, and now he’s diving headfirst into a dangerous political fight at home. What an incredible turn of events. He uses advanced technology not as something to sell, but as a key to unlock a door and find the information he truly needs.
</Person2><Person1>It’s a powerful lesson in looking beyond the obvious. The real value wasn’t in the shield itself, but in what the shield could get him. Now, he faces a new kind of challenge with Jorane Sutt. In our next chapter, Sutt will directly confront Mallow, not just about his wealth, but about his methods. He’ll accuse Mallow of abandoning the Foundation’s religious mission and even threaten him with a trial for murder. It seems Mallow’s troubles are far from over.</Person1>
