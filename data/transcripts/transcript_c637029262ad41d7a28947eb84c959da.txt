<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. When we last saw our trader, Hober Mallow, he had just made a chilling discovery: the Galactic Empire, long thought to be a distant memory, was still supplying advanced weapons to the Periphery. Shaken, he left his ship on a secret solo mission, which has now led him to the doorstep of a weary old man named Onum Barr. Let's step inside.
Imagine the scene. The room is dim, filled with what the text calls a "half gloom." The air is probably still and smells of dust and old wood. And into this quiet decay steps a stranger. His voice is described as "clipped and harsh," and he carries a strange, blue-steel weapon at his hip. More than that, a faint glow surrounds him—a personal force-shield. He is powerful. He is dangerous.
The old man, Barr, seems unfazed. His response is just… tired. "There is no reason to keep it closed," he says about his open door. There's such a profound sadness in that, isn't there? A sense that he has nothing left to protect, nothing left to fear. The stranger introduces himself as Hober Mallow, a trader from a far province, and confirms he’s on a planet called Siwenna. And the old man, with a faint, knowing smile, introduces himself as Onum Barr… once a Patrician of the Empire.
Right away, we see the disconnect between Mallow's world and this one. Mallow is navigating with maps that are one hundred and fifty years old. Think about that. In our world, a map from the late 1800s would be a historical curiosity, not a guide for travel! Barr points out that while the stars don’t change, "political boundaries are all too fluid." Siwenna is no longer the capital. The province has seen, in his words, "rebellion and ruin, ruin and rebellion."
Mallow, ever the trader, immediately hones in on that word: ruin. He’s here to open new markets, and you can’t get money from a world that has none. But Barr sees through Mallow's cover story. He notes Mallow looks more like a fighting man, with a scar on his jaw and his hand always near his gun. Mallow admits that fighting is just a part of business where he comes from—part of a trader's "overhead." But he'd rather get money without it.
This is where the story truly unfolds. Barr, perhaps sensing a rare opportunity to speak with someone, begins to share his history. Mmm… he worries he’s becoming garrulous. That’s a wonderful word, garrulous. It means overly talkative, especially on subjects that don't seem very important. But for a lonely man, sharing his story is the most important thing in the world. And his story… it’s a tragedy.
He explains that Siwenna was once prosperous. But weak Emperors led to strong, ambitious viceroys. Their viceroy, a man named Wiscard, aimed for the "Imperial Purple"—a beautiful metaphor for the Emperor's throne. But Siwenna rebelled against him, hoping to show loyalty to the Empire. They threw open their gates to the Emperor's admiral.
And what did they get for their loyalty? Betrayal. The admiral, you see, wanted the glory of conquering a rebellious province. His men wanted the loot. So, on the pretext that Siwenna had rebelled against its rightful governor, he turned on the people. While they were still in the streets cheering for him, he ordered them put to the nuclear blast. A month of massacre and horror followed.
Barr’s voice, as he tells this, must be trembling. He lost five of his six sons. His daughter… he can only hope she died. He, an old man who helped lead the rebellion for the Empire, was left with nothing. He was punished for depriving an admiral of his glorious conquest. It’s just… chilling. The casual cruelty of power.
Mallow sits in silence, listening. And then, he asks the perfect, gentle question: "What of your sixth son?"
And here is the final, stunning twist in Barr’s tale. The son is alive. He’s serving as a gunner in the viceroy's own fleet, under a fake name. He’s not a traitor to his family; he is an avenger in waiting. He visits his father, keeps him alive, and waits for the day he can be his great and glorious viceroy's executioner. What a powerful, desperate hope to live on.
So, Mallow came seeking markets and information, and instead, he's been given a raw, painful history lesson on the true state of the Empire. He now understands the deep rot at its core.
This encounter gives Mallow a vital piece of the puzzle, but it also raises new questions. He has found an unexpected ally, a man with deep knowledge and a deep-seated hatred for the current regime. But this old man is also sharper than he appears. Next time, we'll see Barr turn the tables, using his knowledge to deduce Mallow's true origins and the secrets of his advanced technology. And Mallow's quest for Siwenna's nuclear power will bring him face-to-face with a new kind of obstacle: an unbribable, hereditary class of technicians who guard their secrets fiercely. Mallow's money and wits might not be enough this time.
Until our next chapter, thank you for listening.</Person1>
