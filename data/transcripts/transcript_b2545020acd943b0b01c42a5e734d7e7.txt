<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Imagine this. The date is August first, nineteen forty-one. The world is engulfed in war. Europe is in flames. But for one young man, a twenty-one-year-old chemistry student named Isaac Asimov, the biggest worry of the day… is that he has no story ideas.
</Person1><Person1>Isn't that just incredible? He’s hurrying to a meeting with the most important science fiction editor of the time, John Campbell, and his mind is a complete blank. He has an appointment to pitch a story, but there’s no story to pitch. (soft laugh) I think every creative person knows that feeling of panic, don't you?
</Person1><Person1>So, what does he do? In a moment of, uh, desperation, he pulls out a book he has with him—a collection of Gilbert and Sullivan plays. He opens it at random. His eyes land on a picture of a Fairy Queen falling at the feet of a soldier. And then, the magic happens. A chain of thoughts begins. Soldiers… military empires… the Roman Empire… a Galactic Empire! Aha!
</Person1><Person1>Just like that, from a single image, an entire universe is born. He imagines writing about the fall of a vast Galactic Empire, inspired by a history book he'd read twice, Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. By the time he gets to his editor's office, he's not just prepared; he's bubbling over with excitement.
</Person1><Person1>And Campbell… well, Campbell catches that excitement. Together, in just one hour, they map out a huge series of stories. They even invent a new science for this universe: psychohistory, a way to predict the future of humanity using mathematics. Mmm… it’s a concept that would define the entire series.
</Person1><Person1>But the creative process is never that simple, is it? Asimov writes the first story, which he calls "Foundation." To make sure the editor has to buy the next one, he ends it on a cliff-hanger. A clever move, you might think. But… he’d outsmarted himself. He quickly wrote himself into a corner, an impasse. It seemed the great Foundation series might die an ignominious death—that's a wonderful phrase, meaning a shameful or disgraceful end—before it even truly began.
</Person1><Person1>Luckily, a chance conversation on the Brooklyn Bridge with a friend pulled him out of the hole. And after that, the stories started to flow. For the rest of the nineteen-forties, his editor, Campbell, kept his nose to the grindstone. That’s a great idiom, by the way. It means he made him work very, very hard, without stopping. Asimov wrote story after story, even while working at a Navy Yard during the war.
</Person1><Person1>But after eight years and nine stories, he grew tired of it. He was ready to move on. He tried to end the series, but his editor wouldn't let him. Campbell forced him to change an ending and promise one more story. (soft laugh) So he wrote the last one, vowing it would be the absolute final chapter. For all that work, nearly a quarter of a million words, his total earnings were just over three thousand six hundred dollars. As far as he was concerned, the Foundation was finished.
</Person1><Person1>But the story of Foundation was far from over. When publishers tried to release the stories in book form, they were rejected by the big companies. A small press, Gnome Press, finally took a chance on them. But even then, the books didn't sell well. For the first decade, they earned almost nothing. It’s a powerful reminder, isn’t it? That sometimes, a great work takes time to find its audience.
</Person1><Person1>The turning point came years later, in nineteen sixty-one, when a major publisher, Doubleday, finally acquired the rights. From that moment on, the books took off. They sold millions. And then, in nineteen sixty-six, something remarkable happened. The World Science Fiction Convention created a special, one-time-only award for the "Best All-Time Series." Asimov was sure that The Lord of the Rings would win. But it didn't. The Foundation series won.
</Person1><Person1>With all this success came a new problem. Readers, editors, and friends all started nagging him. The series covered only a few hundred years of the promised thousand-year gap between empires. They all had the same message: you have to finish it.
</Person1><Person1>He resisted for decades. He was writing non-fiction now; he wasn't in the right mood. Finally, in nineteen eighty-one, his publisher essentially cornered him. They offered him a contract he couldn't refuse, with an advance so large it stunned him. He was terrified. He hadn't written a Foundation story in thirty years. So, what did he do? He sat down and began to re-read his own trilogy.
</Person1><Person1>And he had a moment of pure panic. He found the books… well, a bit boring! He wrote that it was all just thoughts and conversations. No action, no physical suspense. He thought, "What was all the fuss about?" He almost gave the money back. But then he read a critic who perfectly described the series' appeal: it wasn't about action, but about the "detective-story fascination with the permutations and reversals of ideas."
</Person1><Person1>That gave him the confidence he needed. He realized that playing with big ideas was something he could still do. And so, forty years after that first spark of inspiration, he began to write again, creating a new, full-length novel to continue the saga.
</Person1><Person1>It's such a fascinating look behind the curtain, seeing how a legendary work of art came to be—not in one perfect flash, but through chance, struggle, stubbornness, and a little bit of pressure from friends. It tells us that creativity isn't always a straight line; it's a journey filled with detours and happy accidents.
</Person1><Person1>And now… the story itself is about to begin. We are transported to the final days of the first Galactic Empire. A brilliant young mathematician, Gaal Dornick, is traveling to the capital planet, Trantor—a single city that covers an entire world. He has been invited by the legendary Hari Seldon to join a mysterious project, the Psychohistory Project. Gaal is about to meet the man who can see the future, a future that holds the collapse of everything he has ever known. As he steps off his ship, overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the imperial capital, he stands at the very beginning of a thousand-year plan to save civilization. What secrets will he uncover? And can one man’s ideas truly change the fate of a galaxy? Join me next time, as we step into the world of Foundation.</Person1>
