Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide!
Last time, Salvor Hardin showed the Board a scary truth. The ultimatum from Anacreon was a real threat of war. And the Empire’s treaty? It was just empty paper. The Foundation was completely alone. Now, the leaders must face this terrible new reality.
 Can you picture the room? It’s quiet and full of tension. The five leaders of the Foundation are looking at Hardin. They have checked his logic again and again. Dr. Pirenne, the chairman, looks very worried. He finally says, "That seems to be correct." He agrees that the Empire has no power over Anacreon. Anacreon is totally independent.
Hardin leans back in his chair. He asks them, do you think Anacreon doesn't know this? Of course they know! They are proud of their independence. So when the Foundation sent threats about the Empire, it just made Anacreon’s king angry. The king knew the Empire was powerless. Why else would it let Anacreon become independent in the first place?
But one of the men, Sutt, is confused. He asks, "What about Lord Dorwin's promises? He promised the Empire would support us." Mmm... this is a good question. What about the important man from the Empire?
Hardin smiles a little. He says this is the most interesting part. At first, he thought Lord Dorwin was, well, a bit silly. But he was wrong. Dorwin was actually a very clever diplomat. And then Hardin tells them a secret. He says, "I took the liberty of recording all his statements."
 Oh! The room is in shock. Pirenne’s mouth opens in horror. Recording a guest was not a polite thing to do. It was a huge breach of hospitality. That means it was very rude to a visitor in your home. Hardin admits it was not a gentleman's action. But, he says, Dorwin didn't notice. And now, they have a record of everything he said. Hardin sent this recording to be analyzed.
So, the Board was angry about Hardin’s secret recording. But they also wanted to know what the analysis said. What important information did Lord Dorwin give them?
Hardin tells them the result. He says the analysis was very difficult. After two days, the expert removed all the meaningless statements. He took out all the vague words and useless chatter. You know, all the… goo and dribble. And what was left? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. Everything canceled out.
Imagine that! In five days, Lord Dorwin said not one single important thing. But he said it so cleverly that nobody noticed. Hardin tells them, "There are the assurances you had from your precious Empire." It was all just empty air. The Foundation was leaning on a wall that wasn't there.
 So, Hardin explains the situation simply. The Foundation sent threats to Anacreon. But Anacreon's king knew the Empire was weak. The threats just hurt his ego, his pride. So, he sent the ultimatum. And now, Hardin asks the big question again. "We have one week left. What do we do now?"
One man, Sutt, gives up. He says they have no choice. They must let Anacreon build military bases on their planet. Hardin surprisingly agrees. He says, yes, we have to let them come. But then he adds something important. He asks, "but what do we do toward kicking them off again?"
Another man, Yate Fulham, gets nervous. He says it sounds like Hardin wants to use violence. And Hardin says a very famous line. He says, "Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent." Let's pause on that.  "The last refuge of the incompetent." This means that using violence is the final choice for people who are not smart or skilled enough to find a better solution. It’s what you do when you have no other ideas. Hardin is saying he doesn't want to fight. But he also won't just welcome the invaders.
Fulham doesn't like this. He warns Hardin that many people in the city listen to him. He says the Board will not allow Hardin to start a war. A war would be suicide. For the Board, only one thing matters: keeping the Encyclopedia safe. That is their only goal.
Hardin feels like he is running as fast as he can but not moving at all. He tries again to make them understand. The military bases are just an excuse! Anacreon wants to take over completely. They want to make the Foundation part of their kingdom.
Just as everyone is standing and arguing, one man speaks. Jord Fara. He tells everyone to sit down. He calmly says the Board has already made a decision. They believe the real solution will be revealed when Hari Seldon's Vault opens. In just six days.
 Hardin can’t believe it. Their plan is to do nothing? Just wait for a magical answer to pop out of the Vault? He calls this a "deus ex machina." That's a Latin phrase from old plays. It means 'god from the machine.'  In a story, it's when a huge problem is suddenly solved by something new and unexpected, like magic. Hardin thinks waiting for the Vault is like waiting for magic to save them. He calls it foolish escapism—running away from the problem instead of facing it.
Fara just smiles. He reminds Hardin of his own logic. Hari Seldon was the greatest psychologist ever. He must have known this crisis would happen. So, he created the Vault to give them the answer.
But Hardin has thought about this. He says if Seldon knew this would happen, why did he put the Foundation on Terminus? A planet with no metals, far from the center of the Galaxy? Why didn't he warn them earlier? And Hardin makes a powerful point. He says, "Seldon was not a magician." If Seldon could see the solution back then, they should be able to see it now.
The problem, Hardin says, is that they haven't even tried. He accuses them directly. "First, you refused to admit that there was a menace at all! Then you reposed an absolutely blind faith in the Emperor! Now you've shifted it to Hari Seldon." He says they always rely on authority, on the past. They never rely on themselves.
He tells them this is a disease of the whole Galaxy. Just like Lord Dorwin thought archaeology was about reading old books, not digging in the ground. They always trust old authorities instead of their own eyes and their own minds. And Hardin asks them, with all his energy, "don't you see that there's something wrong with that?"
And in the silence that follows, the real question hangs in the air. Will they learn to think for themselves before it's too late?
The Board has chosen to wait for Hari Seldon. But Hardin believes action is needed now. We learn he has been making his own plans, meeting with people who agree with him. He is planning a coup—to take control from the Board. He thinks they are so stuck in the old ways, they won't even see it coming.
And soon, the day arrives. The Board gathers in the Vault. A hologram of Hari Seldon appears. And he says something that will change everything. He says the Encyclopedia project was all a fraud. A lie. It was just a trick to get them all to Terminus, with no way back. Now, he says, the real plan can begin.
