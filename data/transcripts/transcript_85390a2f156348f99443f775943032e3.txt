<Person1>Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Mayor Hardin with a difficult choice. He agreed to repair a giant warship for Anacreon, a kingdom that wants to attack him. His friend Verisof was worried, but Hardin said it was all part of the Seldon Plan. A plan that requires them to act… blindly.
</Person1><Person1>Verisof asks Hardin, "Why? Why must we be blind?" And Hardin explains something incredible. He says Hari Seldon's science, this special psychology, was powerful but also limited.  Imagine trying to know what one tiny drop of water will do in a big river. It's impossible, right? But you can know which way the whole river will flow. Seldon's science was like that. It couldn't predict one person. But it could predict whole planets, huge groups of people. He called them mobs. A mob is just a very, very large group of people. For the plan to work, these mobs, all the people on Terminus, must not know the future. If they know, they might change their actions. And that would break the plan.
</Person1><Person1>Hardin admits he didn't know what would happen when he first faced Anacreon. He just tried to keep things balanced. Only later did he see a pattern. But he tried his best not to use that knowledge. Mmm... that sounds difficult, doesn't it? Knowing something important, but having to pretend you don't. It's like knowing the answer to a test question, but you can't write it down. Any interference, any little change because of what he knew, could knock the whole plan out of kilter. That phrase, 'out of kilter', just means 'not working correctly'. It would break the machine.
</Person1><Person1>So, Hardin believes they must wait for the perfect moment. The crisis. He says the crisis comes when there are no other choices left. On one side, Wienis will get his warship and will surely attack. There's no alternative. On the other side, a new political party on Terminus will soon win the election. They will force Hardin to fight Anacreon. Again, no alternative. When all the doors close and there is only one path left… that is the crisis. That is the moment to act.
</Person1><Person1>But Hardin is worried.  He has a small, nagging feeling. He thinks the plan was for both these problems—the attack from Wienis and the election at home—to happen at the same time. But they are not perfectly timed. Wienis will attack in a few months, but the election is a year away. Is this a small mistake in Seldon's math? Or is it because Hardin himself knew too much? He doesn't know. But he makes a decision. When the crisis begins, he will go to Anacreon himself. He wants to be right there, in the center of the storm.
</Person1><Person1>So, to recap this part: Hardin explains that the Seldon Plan only works if people don't know the future. He is waiting for a crisis, a time with no choices. But he is worried that things are not happening at the exact right time, and he decides to go to Anacreon when the trouble starts.
</Person1><Person1>(soft laugh) Now, let's travel to Anacreon. Let's see what is happening there. Picture a grand old palace. Long ago, it was rich and beautiful, a place for emperors. Now, it is mostly ruins. Cold, empty hallways where the wind blows through. Only one small part of the palace is new and fixed. But one tradition is still alive. The royal sport. Hunting the Nyakbird.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine a giant, feathered bird, a flying fortress. And imagine hunting it in a small, fast air speedster. This is the sport of kings on Anacreon. And the young king, Lepold the First, is very good at it. He is not yet sixteen years old, but he is already a famous hunter. He returns now from another successful hunt, happy and excited.
</Person1><Person1>But a voice stops him. "Lepold!" It is his uncle, Wienis. The regent. The man with the real power. The happy feeling is gone. Wienis looks at the king's hunting clothes with a sour face. He is not pleased. He tells Lepold that soon, he will have more important things to do than hunting.
</Person1><Person1>Lepold doesn't understand his uncle's bad mood. He tries to share the excitement of the hunt, describing the chase, the dive, the final shot. But Wienis cuts him off. "Lepold! Attend!" Pay attention. The fun is over. The king becomes quiet, like a child who has been scolded. He nibbles on a nut, sulking.
</Person1><Person1>Wienis starts to speak. "I've been to the ship today," he says. The one ship that matters. The old Imperial cruiser that the Foundation is repairing. Lepold's reaction is simple. He says, "See? I told you they would fix it. Your story about them wanting to attack us is just poppycock." Mmm, that's a good word. Poppycock. It means 'nonsense' or 'a silly idea'. Lepold thinks his uncle's fears are just poppycock. Why would the Foundation give them a powerful weapon if they planned to attack?
</Person1><Person1>And Wienis's reply is cold and sharp. "Lepold, you're a fool!" The young king is shocked and angry. He reminds his uncle that he is the king, and Wienis is his subject. He will be of age in two months, with full power. He says Wienis should not call him a fool. But Wienis doesn't care. He looks at the king with cold eyes and says it again. "You are a fool, your majesty!"
</Person1><Person1>The young king sits down, defeated. Then, just as quickly, Wienis changes. He puts a hand on Lepold's shoulder. His voice becomes soft and kind. He apologizes. He says the pressure of state affairs is very difficult. But if you could see his eyes, you would see they have not softened at all. He is about to tell the young king something very important, something that will change everything.
</Person1><Person1>So, here on Anacreon, we have a young king who loves to hunt, and his powerful uncle who calls him a fool. Wienis is manipulating Lepold, pretending to be kind after being cruel. He is preparing to tell the king his plan for the Foundation. What is this plan? And will the young, foolish king believe him? We will find out what happens next in our next chapter. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
