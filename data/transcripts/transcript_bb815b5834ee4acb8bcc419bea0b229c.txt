<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, the leader of Anacreon, Haut Rodric, visited Terminus. He told the Foundation leaders that Anacreon wanted to build a military base on their planet. The Foundation's leader, Pirenne, was very angry. But our hero, Salvor Hardin, stayed calm. He seemed to have a plan. Let's see what happens next.
</Person1><Person1>Picture the scene. The tense dinner is over. Pirenne is angry. Rodric, the man from Anacreon, is feeling powerful. But then, Hardin speaks. He asks a very strange question. He asks it in a simple, honest way. He says, "Could Anacreon give us plutonium for our nuclear-power plant?"
</Person1><Person1>Everyone is quiet. A dead silence. Pirenne is shocked. Why is Hardin telling their secrets? (pause) Rodric’s voice changes. He sounds nervous now. He asks, "You have nuclear power?"
</Person1><Person1>Hardin acts like it's normal. He says, of course we do. It's old technology. But, he adds, it's hard to get plutonium. Rodric becomes very uncomfortable. He says they will talk more tomorrow, and then he leaves quickly. Mmm... what just happened? Why did Hardin's question make Rodric so nervous?
</Person1><Person1>As soon as Rodric is gone, Pirenne explodes with anger. He shouts at Hardin. He calls Hardin crazy. But Hardin is calm. He explains his idea. He says Anacreon's real plan was to take their land. But Hardin did not let that happen. He also says his question about nuclear power was very important. It confirmed a suspicion. It proved something he was thinking about.
</Person1><Person1>This brings us to our first language spotlight. The phrase is nuclear power (核能). Nuclear power is a very strong type of energy. In this story, having it means you are powerful. You are advanced. It’s like having the best technology today. Hardin used this idea as a weapon, you know? He didn't use a gun. He used words. He made Anacreon believe that Terminus was strong. So, Hardin’s question showed that Anacreon does not have nuclear power anymore. They are going back to old technology, like oil and coal. Terminus is weak in soldiers, but strong in science. This is a big secret Hardin just learned.
</Person1><Person1>Now, the story moves forward. Hardin is the mayor of Terminus City. He represents the people, not just the scientists. He wants to be in the meetings with the leaders, the Board of Trustees. The scientists don't want him there. But Hardin is clever. He uses his influence with the city's newspaper, the Journal. The people start to demand a voice in the government. Finally, Pirenne agrees. He lets Hardin come to the meeting.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine a big, serious room. Five old scientists are sitting at a long table. They look very important. And at the end of the table sits Hardin. He feels they are not good leaders. He thinks scientists understand facts, but they don't understand people. (pause) Pirenne starts the meeting. He has big news. He says a very important person is coming from the Empire. His name is Lord Dorwin, the Chancellor. Pirenne is very happy. He believes Lord Dorwin will solve their problems with Anacreon. He looks at Hardin, feeling proud.
</Person1><Person1>But Hardin is not impressed. He asks a simple question: What will Lord Dorwin actually do? The scientists are annoyed. They say Hardin is a cynic. A cynic is a person who doesn't believe good things will happen. They believe the Emperor will protect them. But Hardin keeps asking, "How?" He says the Empire is thousands of light years away. It's too far to help.
</Person1><Person1>This leads to our next language spotlight. The word is menace (威胁). A menace is a danger or a threat. Hardin sees Anacreon as a menace. He says, "We've had two months' grace... because we've given Anacreon the idea that we've got nuclear weapons." But this is a lie. They have nuclear power, but not weapons. He says Anacreon is a real menace, and they need guns, not just words, to fight it.
</Person1><Person1>The scientists are shocked. They refuse to build weapons. They say they are a scientific foundation. Their only job is to write the great Encyclopedia. One of them says that building weapons would take people away from the Encyclopedia. And Pirenne agrees. "The Encyclopedia first - always," he says.
</Person1><Person1>This is the real conflict, isn't it? The scientists live in the past. They only care about their books. But Hardin speaks for the one million people on Terminus. He says, "To the rest of us, this is home." Their farms, their houses, their families are what matter. They need protection. But the scientists shout him down. They only care about their mission. Hardin gets very angry. He tells them their science is stagnant. It's stuck. They only classify old knowledge. They don't create anything new. He says this is why the whole Galaxy is falling apart. Systems are losing nuclear power. They are going back to a time of barbarism. It’s a powerful, frightening speech.
</Person1><Person1>So, what's the big takeaway here? We see two different ways of thinking. The scientists trust in old traditions, like the Empire and their Encyclopedia. They believe these things will save them. But Hardin is a pragmatist. He sees the world as it is, not as it was. He knows that power comes from strength, and they need to be strong to survive. He understands that the old ways are dying. A new future is coming, and they must be ready for it.
</Person1><Person1>And that leaves us with a huge question. Who is right? Will the Chancellor from the Empire really save them? Or is Hardin correct that they must save themselves? Next time, we will find out. The 50th anniversary of the Foundation is coming. A special vault, left by the great scientist Hari Seldon, will finally open. Everyone believes it holds a message that will guide them. Hardin, who studied psychology, starts to think Seldon predicted this exact crisis. Perhaps the key to their future is locked inside that vault. Join us next time to see what secrets are revealed.</Person1>
