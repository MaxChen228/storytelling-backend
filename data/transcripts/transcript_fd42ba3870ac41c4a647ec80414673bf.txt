<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Vin was being followed by a mysterious person in the mists. She escaped, but she was left with a big question: who was watching her? Now, let's see what happens next.
</Person1><Person1>Today, we learn a little more about the Lord Ruler. He was a very clever man. He controlled his people for a thousand years. And one way he did this was with technology.
</Person1><Person1>He allowed some technology, like big buildings. This helped him build his great city, Luthadel. But he stopped other technology. For example, he did not allow gunpowder. Gunpowder is a black powder used in old guns.
</Person1><Person1>The Lord Ruler thought gunpowder was dangerous. Why? Because with a simple gun, any person could be a powerful soldier. He didn't want normal people, the skaa, to have that power. He wanted soldiers who needed many years of training, like archers. This made it very hard for the skaa to fight back. It was another way he kept control.
</Person1><Person1>Now, let's go back to Vin and Elend. They are in a small, safe cabin on a boat. It is much better than a tent. Elend is sitting at his desk. He is writing a letter on a thin sheet of metal.
</Person1><Person1>Vin comes in and sits on the bed. She looks worried. Elend asks her, "Are you sure it was the mist spirit?"
</Person1><Person1>Vin isn't sure. She tells him she got scared and ran away. Elend thinks that was a good idea. He remembers when the mist spirit stabbed him. Mmm… that was a very scary time for him. He almost died.
</Person1><Person1>But Vin thinks the spirit is not evil. She believes it was trying to help her. It wanted her to use a special power to save Elend. But Elend is not so sure. He says, "You could be connecting coincidences in your mind." This means he thinks Vin might be seeing a pattern that isn't really there.
</Person1><Person1>Vin feels lost. She says her life is like a book. But the book is in a language she cannot read. She knows the mist spirit is important, but she doesn't understand how.
</Person1><Person1>Elend tries to be logical. He says the spirit helped their friend Sazed. And it tried to stop their enemy, Ruin. So, the spirit is the enemy of their enemy. That should make it a friend, right? At least for now.
</Person1><Person1>But Vin still feels that the spirit hates her. And she feels that the mists are not her home anymore. That is a sad feeling for her. The mists were always her safe place.
</Person1><Person1>Then, Vin tells Elend something amazing. She says, "Tonight, I told someone that I’d stop the ash from falling and turn the sun yellow."
</Person1><Person1>Elend is surprised. Vin says she is the Hero of Ages. It is her destiny. Destiny is what is meant to happen in your life. But Elend smiles a little. He reminds her that the old stories, the prophecies, were changed by their enemy, Ruin. They can't trust destiny.
</Person1><Person1>But Vin is serious. The ash is falling more and more. Soon, the sky will be completely black. Someone has to do something. Elend looks at his wife. She is beautiful, even with ash on her face. And in that moment, he understands something very important.
</Person1><Person1>Vin doesn't need him to believe she is a hero. She doesn't need him to worship her. She needs him to be a good husband. She needs him to be trustworthy.
</Person1><Person1>Let's talk about that word. Trustworthy. If someone is trustworthy, you can believe them. You know they will not lie to you or hurt you. Elend knows their friend Sazed is trustworthy. And now, he knows he must be trustworthy for Vin.
</Person1><Person1>So, he stands up and says, "Well, then. Let’s do it." He tells her he is serious. He will help her save the world.
</Person1><Person1>Vin smiles. And for Elend, that smile makes the world feel a little bit better. But there is a big problem. A really big one.
</Person1><Person1>Vin tells him she cannot share her plan. She found a secret message. It said that their enemy, Ruin, can hear everything they say. It can know everything they write. So, if they talk about the plan, Ruin will know it too.
</Person1><Person1>How can they work together if they cannot talk? Vin takes his hands. She tells him why she married him. It was because he trusted her. And that is what she needs now. Not his help with the plan, but his trust. His hope. Because she doesn't have enough for herself.
</Person1><Person1>Elend understands. He tells her, "You have it."
</Person1><Person1>So, Vin has a secret plan, and Elend trusts her completely. What happens next? Well, Vin needs Elend's help with numbers. She asks him to study information about the mists. He must tell her what to do, but not ask why. It's a strange way to work, but Elend agrees.
</Person1><Person1>Elend also has a plan. He wrote a letter to the enemy king, Yomen. But he doesn't think it will work. If his words fail, he might have to use his army of monsters, the koloss. He does not want to do that.
</Person1><Person1>Then, Vin has a new idea. A crazy idea. She says they should go to a ball. A party… inside the enemy city! It is a very dangerous plan. But it is also very clever. Elend agrees. But then, Vin realizes something important. She doesn't have a dress for the party! We will have to see how they solve that problem next time.
</Person1><Person1>Thank you for listening to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Join us next time to see if Vin can find a dress, and a way into the enemy's party. Goodbye for now.</Person1>
