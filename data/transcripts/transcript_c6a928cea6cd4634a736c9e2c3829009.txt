<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Gaal Dornick in shock. The great scientist Hari Seldon had just shown him the future. Using math, Seldon proved that the great city of Trantor would be destroyed. Gaal asked if Seldon himself was in danger. Let's see what Seldon says.
</Person1><Person1>Seldon is very calm. He says, "Oh, yes." He tells Gaal there is a small chance he will be executed. But, he says this will not stop the project. It seems Seldon has a plan for everything. He tells Gaal he will see him at the University tomorrow. But Gaal does not get to the University.
</Person1><Person1>The next morning, a soft buzzer wakes Gaal up. A polite voice from the hotel desk tells him some news. He is under detention. Mmm… what does detention mean? It means he is not free to leave. He is a prisoner in his own room. The Commission of Public Safety has ordered it. Gaal jumps to the door. He tries to open it, but it is locked. He can only get dressed and wait. So, just one day after arriving, Gaal is already in trouble. He is trapped.
</Person1><Person1>Soon, men come for him. They are polite. They take him to another room and ask him many questions. It all feels very civilized, very calm. But Gaal is not free. They ask about his life, his school, his job with Dr. Seldon. They ask the same questions again and again. How did you hear about the project? What is your job? What is the project about? Gaal tells them the truth. He says he does not know. He is just a mathematician. He is not interested in politics.
</Person1><Person1>Then, a man asks the most important question. He asks it very gently. "When will Trantor be destroyed?" Gaal feels very warm. He is sweating. He doesn't know what to say. He knows the answer, but should he say it? The man, the inquisitor—that is a person who asks questions to get information—tells Gaal something terrifying. He says, "You have been followed, doctor." They watched Gaal at the airport. They watched him on the observation tower. And... they listened to his conversation with Dr. Seldon. (pause) Imagine that feeling. You think you are having a private, secret conversation. But someone was listening the whole time.
</Person1><Person1>Now Gaal knows they have heard everything. So he tells them what Seldon said. He says Seldon believes Trantor will be destroyed in three hundred years. The inquisitor asks if Seldon proved this with math. Gaal says yes, defiantly. He is proud to support Dr. Seldon. He says if Dr. Seldon says the math is good, then it is good. After that, the men say they will return, and they leave. Gaal is alone, but he remembers his rights. He shouts, "Wait! I have a right to a lawyer!"
</Person1><Person1>And he gets one. A tall, thin man enters the room. His face is serious. He introduces himself. "I am Lors Avakim. Dr. Seldon has directed me to represent you." Gaal is upset and scared. He tells the lawyer he wants to see the Emperor. He says he is innocent. But the lawyer, Avakim, is not listening. He is busy taking things out of a small folder. He puts a small recorder on the table.
</Person1><Person1>Avakim then looks at Gaal. He says that the Commission is listening to them right now with a spy device. This is illegal, but they are doing it. (soft laugh) But, Avakim says, his special recorder is blocking their spy device. They are safe to talk freely, for now. This shows us how dangerous the Commission is. They don't follow the rules. So, Gaal and his lawyer have a small, secret moment of safety.
</Person1><Person1>Gaal immediately says he wants to see the Emperor. But Avakim just smiles a little. He tells Gaal that he doesn't understand Trantor. You can't just go and see the Emperor. The real power on Trantor belongs to the rich, aristocratic families. They are the Commission of Public Safety. The Emperor has no real power anymore. This is a big shock for Gaal. The whole system he believed in is not real.
</Person1><Person1>Then Gaal gets an idea. He asks, if Dr. Seldon can predict the future, why didn't he predict this? Why didn't Seldon warn him about the arrest this morning? But then he stops. He remembers that psychohistory is about large groups, not single people. He feels foolish for asking. But the lawyer has another surprise. Avakim says, "But you are wrong. Dr. Seldon was of the opinion that you would be arrested this morning."
</Person1><Person1>What? (pause) Seldon knew. He knew Gaal would be arrested. Avakim explains that the Commission was becoming a problem. Seldon needed to bring things to a climax, to a turning point. So, Seldon visited Gaal to make the Commission act. He was forcing their hand. This is a great phrase. It means to make someone do something that they didn't want to do yet. Seldon used Gaal to start the fight now. It wasn't personal. It was just part of the plan.
</Person1><Person1>Avakim tells Gaal not to worry. It is all part of Seldon's mathematical plan. The plan includes all possibilities. This arrest is one of them. Gaal then asks the most important question: what are the numbers? What are the probabilities? Avakim tells him. For the project, the chance of success is over 99.9 percent. It will almost certainly work. "And for myself?" Gaal asks. The probability for Gaal's safety is 77.2 percent. This means there is a real chance Gaal could be sent to prison, or worse. The danger is not just a number on a screen anymore. It is real, and it is for him.
</Person1><Person1>Gaal is angry. He demands to see Dr. Seldon. But Avakim has one last piece of bad news. He says, "Unfortunately, I cannot. Dr. Seldon is himself arrested." Just then, the door opens. A guard walks in, takes the special recorder, and leaves. Their private conversation is over. Gaal is alone again, with his fear and the terrible numbers.
</Person1><Person1>The story then moves to a trial. It is the third day, but for Gaal, it feels like forever. The trial is not for him, really. All the questions are for Hari Seldon. But Seldon sits there, perfectly calm. He is the only stable thing in Gaal's world now. The room is small, filled with powerful barons who are hostile to them. No one from the public is allowed. It is a secret trial. Seldon is on trial for his ideas, for predicting the fall of the Empire.
</Person1><Person1>And that is where we leave them. Seldon is about to be questioned by the government's lawyer. They think he is a traitor, trying to destroy the Empire with his predictions. But Seldon has a plan. He is about to reveal that the fall of Trantor is only the beginning. He is going to tell them about the fall of the entire Galactic Empire. We will see what happens next time.</Person1>
