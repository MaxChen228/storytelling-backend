<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, Sazed and his friends found a secret door under an old building. It opened into a huge, dark cavern, a secret storage place from the old king. Now, let's see what they find inside.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine you are with them. You are standing on a small ledge, very high up, near the ceiling of this giant cave. It’s dark, but you have a lantern. You look down, and you see long, long rows of shelves. They stretch far into the darkness. It’s a vast chamber, which means it is extremely large.
</Person1><Person1>Spook is the first to speak. He has an idea. He says to Sazed, “I think we should set up our base here.” A base is a safe place, a home for soldiers. Spook thinks this cavern is the only defensible place in the city.
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… defensible. That’s a useful word. A defensible place is a place that is easy to protect from an attack. Think of a castle with very high walls. That is defensible. So, why is this cavern a good place to defend?
</Person1><Person1>Sazed looks back at the doorway they came through. It is very, very small. Only one person can walk through it at a time. This makes it very easy to guard. If enemies try to come in, they can only come one by one. Breeze, their friend, understands this immediately. He says, “Suddenly I feel a whole lot safer in this city.” (soft laugh) I think I would feel safer too.
</Person1><Person1>Sazed nods. He agrees. But then, he turns and looks into the huge, dark cavern again. He listens very carefully. In the quiet, he can hear a soft sound. “Is that water?” he asks.
</Person1><Person1>Spook is already walking down the stone stairs. His voice echoes in the big, empty space. He tells them that each of these secret caches has a specialty. A specialty is one special thing that it has more of than anything else. What could this cavern’s specialty be?
</Person1><Person1>Sazed, Breeze, and Allrianne follow Spook down the steps. More soldiers come into the cavern behind them with more lanterns, but it is still very dark. As they go deeper, Sazed sees something sparkling in the distance. It’s a small light, reflecting from his lantern.
</Person1><Person1>He stops on the steps and holds his lantern high to see better. He realizes that some of the darkness in the distance is perfectly flat. It’s too flat to be the stone floor of the cavern. Can you guess what it is?
</Person1><Person1>It’s water. Not just a little water. As they get closer, they see it is an enormous underground lake. A huge, quiet lake, hidden deep under the city. Breeze lets out a quiet whistle of surprise. “Well,” he says, “I guess now we know where all the water from those canals went.”
</Person1><Person1>So, in this chapter, our friends have found more than just supplies. They have found a safe, defensible base. And, most importantly, they have found a giant source of fresh, clean water. This is an amazing discovery and will help them survive in the city of Urteau.
</Person1><Person1>But while they are making discoveries deep underground, something very different is happening in another city. Next time, we will join Elend and Vin. They are preparing to go to a very important and very dangerous party. Vin has a beautiful new dress, but Elend is worried. What will happen when they meet their enemy at his own ball? Join us next time to find out. Goodbye for now!</Person1>
