<Person1>Welcome back to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Gaal Dornick in a very bad situation. He was arrested, and then he learned that the great Hari Seldon had actually planned for his arrest. Now, both men are at a trial, facing the powerful Commission of Public Safety. Let's see what happens inside that courtroom.
</Person1><Person2>Mmm… can you picture the room? It’s not a happy place. High up, behind a long desk, sit five judges. They are the Commission of Public Safety. Imagine their uniforms, a deep scarlet red and shining gold. On their heads, they wear tight, plastic caps. These caps show that they are judges. They have great power. In the very center sits the most important man, Chief Commissioner Linge Chen. Gaal has never seen such a powerful person before. He just watches Chen, fascinated. But Chen is very still and very quiet. (pause) He doesn't need to speak much. His silence shows his power. The trial has already started, and Hari Seldon is answering questions from a lawyer, the Commission's Advocate.
</Person2><Person1>So, the scene is very serious. The judges are powerful and silent, and Seldon is being questioned by a lawyer.
</Person1><Person2>Exactly. The lawyer looks at his notes and begins. He asks Seldon, "How many men are in your project?" Seldon's answer is simple. "Fifty mathematicians." The lawyer then asks about Gaal Dornick. Seldon explains that Gaal will be the fifty-first member. But the lawyer tries to play a game. He says, "Oh, so fifty-one? Are you sure it's not fifty-two? Or even more?" He is trying to make Seldon look confused or like he is hiding something. But Seldon is calm. He repeats that the number is fifty right now. The lawyer then asks a surprising question. "Is the number closer to one hundred thousand?" Seldon says, "Not mathematicians, no."
</Person2><Person1>The lawyer gets a little angry. He raises his voice. He says he is talking about all the people, in all jobs, not just mathematicians. He says the real number is ninety-eight thousand, five hundred and seventy-two. What a specific number! Seldon, still very calm, says, "I believe you are counting women and children." The lawyer is annoyed by this. He tells Seldon not to argue about small details. "There is no need to quibble," he says. This is our first language spotlight. To 'quibble' (爭辯) means to argue about small, unimportant things. The lawyer wants to talk about the big picture. He feels Seldon is wasting time. Seldon agrees to accept the large number.
</Person1><Person2>So, the lawyer tried to trap Seldon with numbers, but Seldon stayed calm and corrected him. The lawyer is getting impatient.
</Person2><Person1>Yes, exactly. Now the lawyer changes the topic. He asks Seldon to repeat what he thinks will happen to the city of Trantor. Seldon's voice is steady. He says, "Trantor will lie in ruins within the next three centuries." The lawyer asks if Seldon thinks this is a disloyal thing to say. Seldon's answer is amazing. He says, "Scientific truth is beyond loyalty and disloyalty." He means that truth is just truth. It doesn't care about countries or governments. It just… is. The lawyer then asks Seldon to prove his science is real. Seldon says he can only prove it to another mathematician. (soft laugh) He is saying that not everyone can understand it. He compares it to building a power engine. We all use electricity, but how many of us can build the machine that makes it? Seldon says even the very intelligent judges might not understand it. At this, one of the judges leans over and whispers angrily to the lawyer. The lawyer’s face turns red, and he quickly stops Seldon from talking.
</Person1><Person2>So, Seldon is saying his science is true, even if powerful people don't understand it. And the judges do not like hearing that.
</Person2><Person1>That's right. The lawyer then tries a new attack. He suggests that Seldon is predicting disaster because he wants to cause disaster. He says Seldon wants to make people lose trust in the government. He suggests Seldon is building an army of one hundred thousand people. Seldon denies it all. He points out that very few of the people in his project are old enough to be soldiers, and none of them have weapons or training. The lawyer asks if Seldon is working for someone else, an enemy. Seldon says no. He says he is only serving science.
</Person1><Person2>Now comes the really clever part. The lawyer asks, "Can the future be changed?" Seldon says yes, but it is very, very difficult. He explains that the future of billions of people has a huge 'inertia'. Think of inertia like a very, very heavy ball. Once it starts rolling, it is almost impossible to stop or change its direction. You would need another ball just as big and heavy to push it. Seldon says his one hundred thousand people are far too few. They are like a tiny stone trying to stop a giant rolling ball. They cannot stop the fall of the Empire.
</Person2><Person1>The lawyer hears this and sees his chance. A slow smile comes to his face. He speaks very slowly now. "Ah! So, Dr. Seldon… your one hundred thousand people cannot prevent the destruction of Trantor. And you say they are not for any illegal purpose." Seldon agrees. The lawyer leans forward. His voice is loud and sharp now. He has Seldon trapped. He asks the final, big question: "In that case, Dr. Seldon… what is the purpose of your hundred thousand?" The room is suddenly full of noise. Everyone is talking. They all see the trap. Seldon has no good answer, right? But Hari Seldon just waits, calm as ever, for the room to become quiet again.
</Person1><Person2>And then, he gives his answer. "To minimize the effects of that destruction." He is not trying to stop the fall. He is trying to make the fall… softer. But what does that mean? The lawyer asks him to explain. Seldon tells them that the destruction of Trantor is not the real problem. It is just one part of a much bigger story. He says, "I refer, gentlemen, to the developing decline and fall of the Galactic Empire."
</Person2><Person1>(pause) Wow. The room explodes with noise. A dull roar. People are shouting. "Treason!" This is our second language spotlight. 'Treason' (叛國罪) is the worst crime you can commit. It means betraying your country. To them, saying the Empire will fall is the same as being an enemy. The Chief Commissioner, Linge Chen, lifts his gavel—that's a small hammer a judge uses—and hits the desk once. The sound is like a deep gong. And everyone becomes silent. The lawyer, very dramatically, asks Seldon if he understands he is talking about an Empire that has lasted for twelve thousand years. Seldon says he understands its history better than anyone in the room.
</Person1><Person2>Seldon explains that the fall of the Empire is coming. He is not happy about it. He says the time after the Empire, a time of anarchy with no rules, will be much worse. His project is here to fight that anarchy, to make that dark time shorter. He says the Empire looks strong, but it is not. He gives a powerful image. He says the Empire is like a giant, rotten tree. It looks strong on the outside, but inside it is weak and dead. And a storm is coming. He says, "Listen with the ears of psychohistory, and you will hear the creaking."
</Person2><Person1>So, Hari Seldon has revealed his true purpose. It is much bigger and more shocking than anyone imagined. He is not trying to destroy the Empire. He is trying to save what comes after. But he has just admitted to treason in front of the most powerful judges in the galaxy. What can they do to him? What is Seldon’s real plan? Next time, we will learn about his incredible idea to save all human knowledge in an "Encyclopedia Galactica." And we will be there for a secret meeting between Seldon and the powerful Linge Chen, where Seldon will be given a final choice: exile to a distant planet… or death. I hope you'll join me.</Person1>
