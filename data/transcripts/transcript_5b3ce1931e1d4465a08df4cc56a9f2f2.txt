<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left TenSoon in a very difficult place. His own people, the kandra, were punishing him. But in their attempt to humiliate him with the bones of a dog, they accidentally gave him exactly what he needs to escape. Now, let's journey away from TenSoon's prison and join Elend on his difficult path.
</Person1><Person1>The world of the story is changing. There's a very old idea called The Balance. It was a belief that the skaa and the nobility were different kinds of people. The Lord Ruler, a thousand years ago, changed them. He made nobles taller and smarter, but they had fewer children. He made the skaa shorter and stronger, and they had many children. But after a thousand years, these differences are almost gone.
</Person1><Person1>Now, let's find Elend. Picture this. He is standing at the front of a boat, on a long, wide canal. The boat is moving west. Ahead, he sees a city. This is Fadrex City.
</Person1><Person1>The city is not on flat ground. It is nestled between large rock formations. Imagine tall rocks, the color of deep red and orange, rising up like towers. They look like natural walls, protecting the city. Elend can just see the tops of buildings behind these stone walls.
</Person1><Person1>Fadrex City doesn't have a man-made wall like the capital, Luthadel. It doesn't need one. The rocks are its walls, its natural fortifications. Elend has been here before, many years ago with his father. But something is different now.
</Person1><Person1>“The city looks different,” Elend says quietly. His friend, Ham, stands next to him. "Trees," Ham says. "There used to be trees on the rocks." "They cut them down," Ham explains. Why would they do that? Mmm… Ham knows. It’s to prepare for a fight. With no trees, Elend’s army cannot hide. They cannot sneak up close. The city is ready for them.
</Person1><Person1>Elend’s eyes are very sharp because he is an Allomancer. He sees something else. The only way into the city is through a narrow canyon. And inside this canyon, the defenders have cut deep holes into the ground. They are like traps. To attack the city, Elend's army must cross bridges over these pits, with archers probably shooting from the rocks above. It looks very dangerous.
</Person1><Person1>This city is very, defensible. That's a good word. It means the city is easy to defend, or protect, from an attack. The rocks and the narrow entrance make it a very strong place. Cett, the man who rules this city, chose it for his capital. It was a clever move.
</Person1><Person1>But there is another problem. As Elend's boats traveled west, the land became higher. They had to use locks, which are like water elevators for boats. But the last few locks were jammed. It took hours to fix them. The enemy is trying to slow them down.
</Person1><Person1>And there's more. Ham looks back down the dark canal they just traveled. He tells Elend that he doesn't think any more boats can use the canal. There is too much ash from the sky clogging the water. If they want to go home, they will have to walk.
</Person1><Person1>“ ‘If’ we go home?” Elend asks. He sounds a little surprised. Ham just shrugs. He feels that something bad is coming. He says, “It just seems portentous to me.”
</Person1><Person1>Mmm… portentous. That’s an interesting word. It means something feels like a sign, a warning about the future. For Ham, the canal closing behind them feels like fate is trying to trap them here, far from home. It feels like a bad sign.
</Person1><Person1>Elend tries to comfort his friend. “Ham, everything seems portentous to you,” he says with a small smile. “We’ll be fine.” But even as he says it, we can feel the worry. Ham is still looking back, toward the home they left behind.
</Person1><Person1>Elend is the king, the leader. He must be strong. He turns his attention back to the city. He gives orders to his army, telling them where to dock the boats and set up their camp. The challenge is right in front of them: a strong city, ready for a long fight.
</Person1><Person1>So, Elend and his army have arrived at Fadrex City, but their path home is now blocked. They are facing a clever enemy in a city that is like a fortress. But why are they here? Why is this city so important? Elend isn't just here for a battle. He is searching for something the Lord Ruler left behind… a secret storage cache. He believes this cache holds a special hope, something that could save everyone from the falling ash and dying crops. What could be so important? We will have to find out next time. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
