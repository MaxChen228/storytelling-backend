<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we left Spook in a very dangerous situation. He was hurt badly by soldiers and fell into darkness. Now, let’s see what is happening somewhere else, with Elend and his army.
</Person1><Person1> Picture this. Elend is riding a beautiful, big white horse. The horse is very clean, with no ash on it. He sits tall and looks over his soldiers. There are many, many men. It is evening, and the light is soft. But the soldiers are not calm. Mmm… no. Elend can see their fear. He can see their terror.
</Person1><Person1> Why are they so afraid? Well, today, they will face the mists. The mists are a dangerous fog that can make people sick, or even kill them. Elend has a plan. He wants his army to become immune to the mists. That means the mists cannot hurt them anymore. But to do this… they must stand in the mists. They must let the mists touch them.
</Person1><Person1> Elend knows this is scary. He sees the <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="æŋˈzaɪ.ə.ti">anxiety in their eyes. <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="æŋˈzaɪ.ə.ti">Anxiety… that’s a feeling of worry or fear. The soldiers are worried they might be one of the unlucky ones who will die. Who wouldn’t be? The odds are not bad… but that doesn’t help when you are the one standing there, waiting.
</Person1><Person1> So, Elend knows he must be a strong leader. He cannot show his own worry. He rides his horse through the lines of men. The sound of the horse’s feet is like thunder. He wants them to feel his confidence. He wants them to be brave.
</Person1><Person1> He stops his horse and shouts. His voice is loud and strong. “Be strong!” he says. He tells them that yes, the mists will hurt some of them. But most will be okay! And after this, they will never have to fear the mists again. He says this is necessary to win the war, to protect their families.
</Person1><Person1> Then, he says something interesting. He says, “I trust in the Survivor!” The Survivor… that was Kelsier. He tells the men that if some of them die, it is the Survivor’s will. This seems to help. The soldiers stand a little straighter. They look a little stronger.
</Person1><Person1> His general, a man named Demoux, rides next to him. Demoux tells Elend it was a good speech. But then… he asks a difficult question. He asks quietly, “My lord… did you mean what you said about the Survivor?” He is asking if Elend truly believes.
</Person1><Person1> Elend is honest with Demoux. He says he doesn't know what he believes anymore. Faith is hard for him right now. You know, his last god was killed by Vin, the woman he married. And now, the church wants to call Vin a religious figure, but she doesn’t want that. It’s… complicated. So Elend says that believing in the Survivor seems like the only real option left.
</Person1><Person1> Demoux listens. He is a man of deep faith. He tries to explain it to Elend. He says that the Survivor is more than just the man, Kelsier. He believes that when Kelsier was in the terrible prison, the Pits of Hathsin, something changed. Kelsier the man died, and Kelsier the Survivor was born. He was given a great power, and a great purpose.
</Person1><Person1> Demoux says that is why they worship him. He still had the problems of a man, but he had the hopes of a god. He was trying to do something impossible. And he did it. This belief gives Demoux and the other followers their strength.
</Person1><Person1> Their conversation shows us how important belief is for these people. For Elend, it is a tool for leadership. For Demoux, it is everything. It is the reason for hope in a dark, ashy world. Elend sees the trust his soldiers have in him. And that trust makes him more <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dɪˈtɜː.mɪnd">determined. That word, <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dɪˈtɜː.mɪnd">determined… it means he has made a strong decision to do something, and nothing will stop him. He is <phoneme alphabet="ipa" ph="dɪˈtɜː.mɪnd">determined to save them.
</Person1><Person1> But as they sit there, talking about faith and gods… the mists begin to arrive. And suddenly, the soldiers start to scream. Men fall to the ground as if their strings were cut. The terrible moment has come. Elend feels he must do something, he must lead. But then he looks over at his friend, Demoux. The man with such strong faith. And he watches in shock as Demoux himself collapses, shaking horribly on the ground. What will Elend do now, with his army in chaos, and one of his strongest friends suddenly so sick? We will find out next time. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
