<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! I am so happy you are here with us today.
</Person1><Person2>Last time, we left young Gaal Dornick on the giant planet of Trantor. He felt so small in that huge, metal world. He was excited, but also a little lost. He had not even seen the real sky yet.
</Person2><Person1>As Gaal leaves the information desk, he doesn't notice something. A person who was standing in the crowd starts to follow him. Mmm... that's a little strange, isn't it? Gaal has no idea.
</Person1><Person2>He just wants to find a hotel. He walks up to a railing where a sign says "Supervisor." The man there doesn't even look up. He just asks, "Where to?"
</Person2><Person1>Gaal feels a little nervous. There are many people waiting behind him. He doesn't have much money. But he wants to seem cool and confident. So he tries to sound, uh, nonchalant. He says, "A good hotel, please."
</Person1><Person2>Nonchalant? What does that mean?
</Person2><Person1>Oh, that's a great question! Nonchalant (滿不在乎的) means you act very calm and relaxed. You act like you don't have any worries. Gaal was worried about money, but he tried to act like he wasn't.
</Person1><Person2>I see. So he was pretending to be cool.
</Person2><Person1>Exactly! But the Supervisor is not impressed. He says, "They're all good. Name one." Poor Gaal! He doesn't know any hotels on Trantor. He just says, "The nearest one, please."
</Person1><Person2>So what happens? How does he find it?
</Person2><Person1>This is where it gets interesting. The Supervisor pushes a button. Suddenly, a thin line of light appears on the floor. It's Gaal's personal path! The Supervisor gives him a ticket that glows. He says, "Follow the light."
</Person1><Person2>Wow! Imagine that. A light on the floor to guide you through a giant city. No map, just a glowing line to follow.
</Person2><Person1>Yes! Gaal looks around. He sees hundreds of other people, all following their own colored lights. They are all moving across the giant floor, like little streams of water finding their way. (pause) It's so organized, but also so... impersonal. You don't talk to anyone, you just follow your light.
</Person1><Person2>And his light leads him to a taxi?
</Person2><Person1>It does. A man in a bright uniform takes his bags. He says the taxi goes directly to the Luxor Hotel. And the person who was following Gaal hears this. He now knows where Gaal is staying.
</Person1><Person2>That feels... a little scary.
</Person2><Person1>It does. Gaal gets into the taxi. It lifts straight up! He looks out the window, amazed. He is flying inside a building. The people below look like tiny ants. Then, the taxi flies into a dark tunnel in a huge wall. For a moment, it's completely black. Then, pop! It comes out of the tunnel and lands. "The Luxor Hotel," the driver says.
</Person1><Person2>And through all of this... did he see the sky?
</Person2><Person1>No. Not once. From the moment he arrived, there has been no glimpse of the sky. Everything is under a metal roof.
</Person1><Person2>It's hard to imagine a whole planet like that.
</Person2><Person1>It is. The story gives us a little information from a book called the Encyclopedia Galactica. It tells us that Trantor is one single, giant city. The city covers the whole planet. Think about that! No forests, no oceans, just city. Over forty billion people live there.
</Person1><Person2>Forty billion! That is so many people. What do they all do?
</Person2><Person1>They work for the government, running the huge Galactic Empire. But here is the most important part. Trantor does not grow its own food. Every day, thousands of ships bring food from other planets.
</Person1><Person2>So... if those ships stopped coming...
</Person2><Person1>Exactly. The book says this is Trantor's jugular vein. A jugular vein (頸動脈) is a very important part of your neck. It carries blood. It is a point of great weakness. For Trantor, its need for food is its great weakness. If an enemy stops the food ships, Trantor is in big, big trouble.
</Person1><Person2>But Gaal doesn't know this, does he?
</Person2><Person1>No, not at all. He's just a visitor. In his hotel, he feels confused. He doesn't know if it's day or night. He looks for a "Sun Room," but it's just a room with artificial lights. He really wants to see the outside. He wants to see the sky.
</Person1><Person2>So he asks for help?
</Person2><Person1>He does. He asks the hotel clerk about a tour, or an observation tower. The clerk says, "Sure, you can go to the tower." But he also says something very strange. He says, "I don't bother with the outside myself. The last time I was in the open was three years ago."
</Person1><Person2>Three years? He lives there and hasn't been outside in three years?
</Person2><Person1>It tells you a lot about life on Trantor, doesn't it? For many people, the "outside" doesn't matter. (pause) But it matters to Gaal. He gets a ticket and goes to a special elevator.
</Person1><Person2>And this elevator is special too, I bet.
</Person2><Person1>It is! It runs on gravity. As it goes up, Gaal suddenly feels like he has no weight. He starts to float! His feet leave the floor. (soft laugh) He makes a little noise, like "ah!" He is so embarrassed. The other people in the elevator are smiling. They put their feet under a railing on the floor to stay down.
</Person1><Person2>Oh, poor Gaal! That sounds so awkward.
</Person2><Person1>It is! But then, a man reaches out and pulls him down. Gaal is very thankful. The elevator stops, and he steps out onto an open terrace. It is so bright, it hurts his eyes.
</Person1><Person2>He's finally outside!
</Person2><Person1>Yes. And the kind man who helped him is right behind him. Gaal goes to the railing to look. And what he sees... is just... more city. He cannot see the ground. He can only see buildings and metal. The horizon isn't land and sky. It is metal and sky. A gray sky.
</Person1><Person2>No green at all?
</Person2><Person1>No green. No soil. No trees, no flowers. Only the work of man. He knows the Emperor's palace is somewhere on this planet, a small green island in an ocean of steel. But he can't see it. It could be thousands of miles away.
</Person1><Person2>So what does he feel, seeing this?
</Person2><Person1>He feels amazed. He is not thinking about the jugular vein, the weakness. He only sees the power. He sees the mightiest work of humanity. He feels that he is finally here, on Trantor, the center of the whole galaxy.
</Person1><Person2>He is impressed by the power, but we know about the danger. It's a big contrast.
</Person2><Person1>A very big contrast. And as Gaal stands there, looking at this amazing, powerful, and fragile city... he is not alone. That kind man from the elevator is still there. Who is he? Is he just a friendly person? Or is he someone else? (pause) We will find out soon. And we will also find out what happens when Gaal finally meets the great Hari Seldon. Because Seldon is about to share a terrible secret about Trantor's future. A secret that will change everything.
