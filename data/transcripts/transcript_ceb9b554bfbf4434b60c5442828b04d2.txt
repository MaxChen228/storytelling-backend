<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, we left Vin with a secret thought. She realized the dark power in the world was not a monster, but something with rules. At the same time, Elend was worried. He was afraid of becoming a cruel king, like the one they defeated. Just then, a cheerful man named Noorden arrived with a book full of numbers. And those numbers… well, they are about to change everything.
</Person1><Person1> Let’s picture the scene. Vin and Elend are standing on the deck of a ship. Ash is falling softly from the sky, covering everything in a layer of grey dust. Noorden, the obligator, is there with his big book. This book is called a ledger. A ledger is a special book where you write down important numbers. In this case, it holds numbers about life and death.
</Person1><Person1> “It was a difficult task,” Noorden says in his friendly, chatty way. He explains that he counted all the sick and dead soldiers. Elend looks at the ledger. He says, “Fewer dead than expected.” He seems a little relieved. But Vin… Vin isn’t looking at the number of dead. She feels a little itch in her mind. Something is not right. She looks up at Noorden. “How do you know how many should have died?” she asks. Her voice is quiet, but full of curiosity.
</Person1><Person1> Noorden explains that they have been studying this new disease. They want to find a way to treat it. But Vin interrupts him. She is focused. “You have exact numbers?” she asks. She wants to know precisely how many people got sick. Not about how many, but the exact number. Noorden checks his ledger again. “Five thousand, two hundred and forty-three,” he says.
</Person1><Person1> Then Vin asks a very smart question. “What percentage of the soldiers is that?” she asks. A percentage is a way to understand a number out of one hundred. Noorden and his helper do some calculations. The answer is about thirteen and a half percent. But Vin is still thinking. She asks them to do the calculation again, but with a different group of soldiers. Elend watches her. He is curious now, too. “What is this about, Vin?” he asks. “I’m… not sure,” she says honestly.
</Person1><Person1> Noorden finishes the new calculation. He stops. He looks surprised. He says something quietly to himself. “What is it?” Vin asks. Noorden looks up. He says the calculation came out to be an exact number. “Precisely sixteen percent of the soldiers fell sick,” he says. “To the man.” Mmm… that is very specific, isn't it? Elend thinks it’s just a coincidence. A coincidence is when two things happen by chance, without a real connection. He says that with big numbers, strange things can happen. It can look special, but it’s just statistics. It’s just chance.
</Person1><Person1> “A simple coincidence,” Noorden agrees. But Vin doesn't think so. “Check your ledgers,” she says. “Find percentages for other groups of people.” So Noorden looks. He finds the number for another group. He looks up from the book, his eyes wide. “Sixteen,” he says. Another exact percentage. Now Elend is frowning. He steps closer to look at the numbers himself. They check a third group. It’s not a perfect sixteen percent… but it’s only off by one single person. It is almost exactly sixteen percent.
</Person1><Person1> It doesn’t matter if the people are old or young. It doesn’t matter where they live. Every time a group of people goes into the mists, sixteen percent of them get sick. Not about sixteen percent. Exactly sixteen percent. A hundred scouts went into the mists, and exactly sixteen of them got sick. This is… very strange. Elend kneels down on the ash-covered deck, looking closely at the numbers. “This is wrong, Vin,” he says. “Very wrong.”
</Person1><Person1> A normal disease doesn't work like this. A normal disease is random. Sometimes more people get sick, sometimes fewer. There should be a curve, a variation. But this sickness… it is like a law of nature. It is a perfect, unchanging rule. The number of people who get sick is always sixteen percent. Always. Elend stands up, looking troubled. He tells Noorden to check everything again, to be sure. But he asks, what if it’s not a coincidence? What does it mean?
</Person1><Person1> Elend doesn’t know. But Vin thinks she does. It means there are rules. There are consequences. It proves what she was thinking before. This dark power… it follows laws. And now, they have found one of those laws. The number sixteen. But why? Why that number? What does sixteen percent mean? They have a clue, a very important clue, but no answer.
</Person1><Person1> And they may not have time to find one. Because next time, Elend, now an emperor with new and powerful abilities, must lead his army. He will fight the giant, monstrous koloss himself. As his army begins to fail, and all hope seems lost, he points to the sky. A small spot is growing larger. What is it? Is it the help he has been waiting for? We will find out in our next chapter. Thank you for listening, and goodbye for now.</Person1>
