<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time we met, the trader Limmar Ponyets seemed to be caught in a perfect trap. The ambitious politician Pherl had forced him to stay on his planet for a week as a guarantee for a gold-making machine, a transmuter. Ponyets was heading down to Pherl’s mining estates to collect his payment, a huge shipment of tin, and we were left wondering how he could possibly escape Pherl’s inevitable double-cross.
</Person1><Person1>Well, it turns out, the trap was never for Ponyets. It was for Pherl. In a conversation with his colleague Gorov, Ponyets reveals his secret weapon. It wasn't just his word against Pherl's. You see, Pherl had never even heard of a microfilm-recorder. (soft laugh) It’s such a simple piece of technology to the Foundation, but completely unknown to Pherl.
</Person1><Person1>Can you just imagine the scene? Ponyets describes acting completely defeated, setting up the transmuter for Pherl in what he calls a "whipped-dog fashion"—that means acting beaten and submissive, with his tail between his legs, so to speak. But while doing this, he secretly built the tiny recorder right into the machine. He then removed it the next day during a supposed "overhaul."
</Person1><Person1>He got a perfect recording of Pherl in his most private, secret room—his sanctum sanctorum. That's a Latin phrase meaning 'the holy of holies,' a place of ultimate privacy. And the recording caught Pherl using the machine, crowing over his first piece of gold "as if it were an egg he had just laid." The image is just perfect, isn't it? It captures Pherl’s childish pride and greed.
</Person1><Person1>Two days later, Ponyets showed him the recording. Now, you have to remember, Pherl had never seen three-dimensional, color-sound images in his life. To him, it must have seemed like black magic. The text says he was absolutely terrified, "gibbering at my knees in half a second." Ponyets then told him he had another recorder ready to broadcast the images in the city square for everyone to see. Of course, he didn't... but Pherl believed him. At that moment, Pherl was ready to make any deal Ponyets wanted. And he did. He bought every piece of technology Ponyets had, paying for it all with as much tin as their ships could carry.
</Person1><Person1>Mmm... it's a masterful piece of blackmail. Gorov points out that Ponyets has no sense of morals, but Ponyets just shrugs it off. He got the job done. He not only freed Gorov and made a huge profit, but he also ensured that Pherl, who will now become the next Grand Master, is firmly in the Foundation's debt. A brilliant, if ruthless, victory.
</Person1><Person1>And with that, we leave Ponyets behind and jump into a new era for the Foundation. This is Part Five: The Merchant Princes. The introduction tells us that with wealth came power for the traders, and it introduces us to a man named Hober Mallow, who started as an ordinary trader and ended as the first of these Merchant Princes.
</Person1><Person1>We meet him in an office with a high-ranking politician, Jorane Sutt. The atmosphere is tense. Sutt is smooth, careful, a man of the central government. Mallow is… not. He's from the Outer Worlds, a Master Trader, and he is direct, almost confrontational.
</Person1><Person1>Sutt reveals a serious problem. Three of the Foundation’s trade ships have disappeared near the Korellian Republic. These ships were heavily armed with nuclear weapons and force fields. For them to just vanish means they were met with even greater power. The chilling question is: where is Korell getting nuclear weapons?
</Person1><Person1>Sutt suggests two possibilities. Either the Korellians built them, which he thinks is far-fetched, or… there’s been treason. Someone from the Foundation's territories is secretly selling weapons to an enemy. And as he says this, he’s looking right at Hober Mallow, a man born in the Outer Worlds, whose ancestors might have been nobles who lost everything when the Foundation took over.
</Person1><Person1>Mallow’s reaction is fantastic. He gets angry, a dull red color rising in his face. He makes it clear his family was poor and that he owes nothing to the old regime. But he is proud of where he comes from. And he delivers this incredible line: "Your sly little hints of treason aren't going to panic me into licking Foundation spittle." Let's pause on that phrase. "Licking spittle." It's a very strong, very graphic idiom. It means to be disgustingly flattering and submissive to someone in power. Mallow is telling Sutt, in no uncertain terms, that he will not be intimidated into groveling.
</Person1><Person1>But Sutt is a clever politician. He says he wasn't accusing Mallow. He was just showing Mallow that he had done his research. He needs Mallow precisely because he is an Outlander. Because he knows these territories. He knows Korell. He wants to send Mallow there, officially as a trader, but unofficially as a spy, with his eyes wide open, to find out where Korell's power is coming from.
</Person1><Person1>Mallow, a man of action, simply asks, "When do I start?"
</Person1><Person1>The chapter ends, however, with a sense of deep unease. We see Sutt talking with his superiors, and they admit their plan is a crude one. They are sending Mallow into this dangerous situation without knowing the outcome. They use a powerful metaphor, saying it's like "paying out rope on the chance that somewhere along the length of it will be a noose." They're hoping Mallow will either uncover the traitor or that the traitor will reveal themselves by trying to stop Mallow. It's a huge gamble, and Mallow is the bait.
</Person1><Person1>And as we look ahead, we learn this is no simple spy mission. The Foundation is officially facing its third Seldon Crisis—a moment of extreme danger predicted by psychohistory. Sutt has sent Mallow away, perhaps to get a political rival out of the picture, but in doing so, he may have placed the Foundation's fate in Mallow's hands. Mallow knows a crisis is coming, and with no clear strategy, he prepares to head into the unknown, ready to improvise his way through the storm. What he finds in the Korellian Republic will change everything.</Person1>
