<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Elend made a very difficult choice. He decided the army must march to Fadrex City, a place beyond the safety of the mists, to find a hidden storage cache. Now, inside the command tent, he explains the full weight of his plan.
</Person1><Person2>Picture it… Elend is standing in front of a large map. The other leaders are watching him. He points to the map and his voice is serious, clear. “We march for Fadrex,” he says again. He explains that this is about more than just one city. It’s about saving everyone.
</Person2><Person2>He tells them that the Central Dominance, their home, is the only place that can grow food this summer. To survive, they must bring all the people of the empire there. And that starts with bringing the people of Fadrex under their protection. But… there’s another problem.
</Person2><Person2>Elend points to a different spot on the map, a city called Urteau. He says they must also suppress the rebellion there. Mmm… that word, ‘suppress’. It means to stop something, usually with force. Like putting out a small fire before it becomes a big one. Elend wants to stop this rebellion before it spreads.
</Person2><Person1>I see. So it's a two-front problem.
</Person1><Person2>Exactly. Urteau is dangerous. Not only does it have a storage cache with grain they need, but its new leaders are building an army. An army that is close to their capital city, Luthadel. Elend will not let another army attack his home.
</Person2><Person2>But Ham, always practical, points out the obvious. “We don’t have enough troops to march on both fronts at once, El.” They can’t fight two wars at the same time.
</Person2><Person2>Elend knows this. He wants to avoid a fight in Urteau if he can. He has a different idea. He sends a message to a spy, and the spy says the rebels are skaa—their own people. So, Elend decides to send a team to talk to them. He chooses Breeze and Sazed to go to Urteau and bring the city to their side without using force.
</Person2><Person2>Sazed, however, is hesitant. He asks Elend if he truly needs to go. He says he has personal research to do. But Elend insists. He tells Sazed that people trust him. He is the Holy Witness. He is the perfect ambassador to balance Breeze’s… well, his reputation. Sazed finally agrees, but his face is hard to read.
</Person2><Person2>With the plan set, the mood in the tent is heavy. They are talking about sieges, rebellions, and the world ending. Then, Elend asks something strange. “I want you to tell me about the Survivor,” he says. He wants to know about Kelsier, the man, not the god everyone worships.
</Person2><Person2>The room is quiet. Then, his old friends begin to speak. Ham says Kelsier was… grand. Bigger than just a man. Breeze says he was genuine, real, in a world of fakes. Vin says quietly, “He was a man. Just a man. Yet… you always knew he’d succeed.”
</Person2><Person2>Elend listens to all of this. He wishes he had known Kelsier. Then he asks the most important question. “What do you think he’d say, if he saw us now?” He means, what would Kelsier think of them now, sitting in a tent, arguing and worried.
</Person2><Person2>And this is a key moment. The tent is completely still. And then Sazed, the quiet Keeper, whispers the answer. “He’d tell us to laugh more.”
</Person2><Person1>Laugh? At a time like this?
</Person1><Person2>It sounds strange, doesn’t it? But Ham explains. For Kelsier, laughter was a weapon. It was something the old, evil empire could never take from him. He planned to overthrow a thousand-year empire… and he did it with a smile. Every joke was his way of fighting back against a dark world.
</Person2><Person2>And Elend understands. That is what they are missing. They bicker and worry. To ‘bicker’ means to argue about small, silly things. They are so focused on the falling ash and the shaking ground that they have forgotten how to hope. Elend says, “We need what he had.”
</Person2><Person2>So, they have a military plan, yes. But Elend has found something more important: a reason to fight with hope instead of fear. He now sees that Kelsier’s true power wasn’t just in his magic, but in his spirit.
</Person2><Person2>And with this new energy, Elend will inspire his friends. Next time, he will challenge them to smile, to laugh in the face of disaster, just like Kelsier did. But not everyone will find it so easy. The army prepares to march at dawn. Thank you for joining Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). We'll see you next time.</Person2>
