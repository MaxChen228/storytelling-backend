Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. 
Last time, we saw Elend show a terrifying map. The mists were covering the world, and soon, there would be no place left to grow food. They realized their real enemy was a dark force called Ruin, and their only hope was finding the Lord Ruler's last secret storage cache. So, the question was… what would they do next?
Let’s return to that tense meeting. Picture the leaders, gathered in a large tent. Elend is speaking. He reminds everyone that each cache they have found contained food and water, yes, but also something new and important. In one city, Vetitan, they found special metals for Allomancers. He believes this final cache holds the key to their survival.
Suddenly, a gruff voice cuts through the tension. It’s Cett. He has a big, bushy beard, and a broad smile appears on his face. “That’s it, then!” he says, full of excitement. “We are marching on Fadrex, aren’t we?”
Elend just nods. He looks very serious. “Yes,” he says. The main army will march as soon as they can. Cett lets out a loud laugh. “Ha!” he says. He’s happy because this will make two other kings, Penrod and Janarle, very unhappy. You see, there is a lot of politics happening. Penrod and Janarle didn’t want the army to go to Fadrex, which is Cett’s homeland. Cett calls them… well, he uses a word that Elend does not like at all.
Elend shakes his head. “Does everything you say have to contain one vulgarity or another?” he asks. A vulgarity is a rude or offensive word. Cett just shrugs. He thinks swearing makes his words more interesting. Elend disagrees. Cett just smiles and says that in his homeland, people think words like 'damn' are too pretty to use! (soft laugh) It shows you how different these leaders are, doesn't it?
And then… the ground begins to shake.
It's an earthquake. In an instant, Vin is on her feet, ready for danger. The others grab onto tables and chairs to stay balanced. Vin rushes to the tent flap and looks outside into the mists. The shaking stops very quickly. It wasn't a big one, and the soldiers in the camp are mostly calm. Inside the tent, a few chairs have fallen over. Everyone slowly sits back down. Ham, one of their friends, says, “Sure have been a lot of those lately.”
Vin looks at Elend. She can see the worry in his eyes. It’s a silent question between them. We can fight armies, we can capture cities, but what about ash, mists, and earthquakes? What about the world falling apart around us?
Elend takes a deep breath and makes his voice firm. He says they must go to Fadrex. They cannot miss what is in that cache. As he speaks, a voice whispers in Vin’s mind. It sounds like her brother, Reen. And it says one word. “Atium,” Vin says out loud.
The whole room changes. Cett gets excited again. He wants to know if they really think atium is there. Atium is the most powerful and valuable metal in the world. Elend is careful. He says it’s only a theory, with no proof. But Vin… Vin is sure. “It will be there,” she says. She feels it. They have to have it.
But Ham asks another important question. “Are you talking about conquering Fadrex City?” The room goes silent. Until now, Elend’s army has only been used for defense. They have never attacked a large, strong city. Elend says their first goal is diplomacy, which means they will try to talk and make an agreement. But Cett doesn’t want to talk. He says the city was stolen from him. He believes the soldiers there turned against him and deserve to be attacked. Elend and Ham disagree. They argue that those are Cett’s own people. Maybe the soldiers had no choice.
This is where we get our new word for today: siege. Cett and Elend look at each other, and they seem to have the same idea. Cett says the word first. “Siege.” A siege is when an army surrounds a city. They don't attack directly. Instead, they stop anyone from bringing food or supplies into the city. They wait. The people inside the city get hungry and desperate. Eventually, they have to surrender. Elend agrees this is the best plan if diplomacy fails. They have food from the other caches. The people in Fadrex probably do not. They can outlast them.
But there is one more problem. Sazed, the quiet, wise scholar, finally speaks. “The mists,” he says. He reminds them that Fadrex City is outside the area where the mists are weakest. To get there, the army must march through the deep mists. And they know that about fifteen percent of people who go into the mists get sick and die. Will Elend risk losing so many of his soldiers before they even arrive?
Elend is quiet for a moment. He looks at Sazed and nods. It is a good point. But he makes a hard decision. He says they cannot protect the soldiers from the mists forever. The army must face the mists, just like the villagers did, to become immune to the sickness. Vin hears this and feels… conflicted. It seems a little unfair, but she also understands that it is necessary for survival.
So, the plan is set. They will march on Fadrex, through the deadly mists. They will try to take the city peacefully, but if they can't, they will lay siege to it. All for the hope of finding atium, and the secret to saving the world.
And as they prepare for this great challenge, another problem is waiting. There is a rebellion in a city called Urteau, a city with a lot of grain they desperately need. Elend must send some of his best people, Breeze and Sazed, to solve this problem… without any violence. And as the weight of the world settles on their shoulders, they begin to ask themselves: what would their old leader, the legendary Kelsier, do? They need to find his spirit of hope and defiance if they are going to win this war against the end of the world.
