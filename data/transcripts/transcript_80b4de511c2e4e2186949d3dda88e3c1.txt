<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left the kandra, TenSoon, facing a terrible judgment from his own people. He tried to warn them about a great danger, but they sentenced him anyway. Now, let’s leave that cold, dark place and find out what our other friends are doing.
</Person1><Person1>We need to start with a very big secret. A secret about the Lord Ruler, Rashek. You see, he did something incredibly clever long ago. He moved the Well of Ascension. He hid it. He knew that the Well’s amazing power would one day return. Power like that doesn't just disappear forever. It always comes back. So, he changed the whole world to protect his secret.
</Person1><Person1>Imagine this. He moved mountains to the North and called that land Terris. Then, he made his own homeland flat and built his capital city there. At the very center of his palace, he built a special room. It was a copy of his old, simple home. A safe place he made just before his own power ran out. Mmm… very clever, and very secret.
</Person1><Person1>Now, let's go to a much smaller room, where Vin and Elend are. Picture Vin, sitting on their simple bedroll. She looks worried. Elend is looking in a mirror, getting dressed. He’s putting on his bright white uniform. It has shiny gold buttons. It’s made to look regal. That word, regal, means he looks like a king. Important and powerful. His white clothes are a symbol of hope in this dark, ashy world.
</Person1><Person1>Vin breaks the silence. “I’m worried about him, Elend,” she says quietly. Elend asks who she means. Sazed? Vin nods. She says Sazed is different now. He lost someone he loved, Tindwyl. But it’s more than just sadness. Vin thinks Sazed lost his faith. He used to believe that everything would be okay in the end. He trusted that something good was watching over the world. Now… he doesn't have that trust anymore.
</Person1><Person1>Elend tries to understand, but he’s a practical man. He says they have all lost people. But Vin sees more. She’s worried about their other friends, too. “It’s not just him, Elend,” she says. “Breeze tries too hard.” Elend is amused. What does that mean? Vin explains that Breeze is always Pushing on people’s emotions to make them feel happy. He laughs too loudly. She says he is overcompensating.
</Person1><Person1>That's an interesting word, isn't it? Overcompensating. It’s when you try too hard to hide a feeling by showing the opposite. Breeze is afraid, so he acts extra happy and makes lots of jokes. He’s trying to cover up his fear. Vin can see it. She knows her friends are giving up hope, one by one.
</Person1><Person1>Elend listens. He turns back to the mirror and looks at himself. He sees the scars, the beard, the strong body of a warrior. But he looks deeper, into his own eyes. He’s searching for the king that he is supposed to be. And he’s not sure he sees one. (soft laugh) But he knows he has to keep trying. He is the best they have.
</Person1><Person1>So he makes a promise. “Very well,” he says. “I trust that you’re right… I’ll do something to fix it.” Because that is his job now. As the emperor, he has only one duty: to make everything better. What a difficult job to have.
</Person1><Person1>Elend has a new mission: to bring hope back to his friends and his people. But how can he do that when the world itself seems to be dying? Next time, we will see his plan. Elend will show everyone a map, and it will not be good news. The map will show that their world is shrinking, that the dangerous mists are covering everything. Soon, there will be no place left to grow food. And they will finally learn the name of their true enemy… a terrible thing that was trapped in the Well of Ascension. A thing called Ruin. Join me next time to see what happens. Goodbye for now!</Person1>
