<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). Last time, we were with Marsh. He made a very brave, and very secret, plan. He decided to fight back against the evil force controlling him, even if it meant giving his own life. Now, let’s leave Marsh with his quiet plan, and find Vin. Because for her, the world is changing in a very visible, and very strange, way.
</Person1><Person2> It all starts with the ash. For a thousand years, ash fell from the sky. The story tells us people were very fortunate back then. The old ruler, Rashek, had made special plants and something called microbes. Microbes are very, very small living things. So small you cannot see them. These tiny helpers would break down the ash, cleaning the land. Without them, the world would have been buried.
</Person2><Person1> But now, something else is a problem. The mists burned. Can you imagine that? It’s daytime, but the mists are everywhere. The red sun shines through them, making them glow like a fire all around Vin. This is not natural. Mists should only come at night.
</Person1><Person2> And Vin feels it. The mists used to be her friend. Mmm… they were her protection, a shadow to hide in. But now, they feel… alien. That means they feel strange, like they don't belong. When Vin uses her Allomancy, her special magic, the mists actually pull away from her. It’s like a wild animal that is afraid of a bright light.
</Person2><Person1> Because of this, the whole army is hiding. The soldiers stay in their tents, waiting for the mists to go away. Elend, Vin’s husband and the emperor, has a difficult plan. He believes the soldiers must go into the mists. They need to become immune, which means the mists can no longer make them sick.
</Person1><Person2> Their friend, Ham, does not like this plan. He asks Elend, “You’d really stand by and watch your own soldiers die?” Ham cares for every single soldier. He knows their names. The idea of losing even one is painful for him.
</Person2><Person1> But Elend says they must. “Slowing down costs lives,” he explains. They need to get to the city of Fadrex quickly. It is a terrible choice, isn't it? Risking some lives now to hopefully save many more later. Vin agrees with Elend. The army cannot be weak. They cannot be dependent on the whims of the mists, waiting for them to decide to leave.
</Person1><Person2> As Vin walks through the camp, the soldiers see her. Some look away, uncertain. But many others bow their heads. They show her reverence. Reverence is a feeling of very deep respect. To them, Vin is more than an empress. She is a religious figure, a hero. And that is a heavy title for her to carry.
</Person2><Person1> She doesn’t want to be a religious figure. She is just… Vin. And she is worried. She has asked Sazed and Elend about the mists. Are they natural, like the weather? Or are they something else? Sazed, the wise scholar, believes they are natural. He says, some people get sick from the mists, but others do not. It’s like an insect sting, he explains. It can kill one person, but barely bother another.
</Person1><Person2> Mmm… but Vin isn't convinced by theories. She has a special connection to the mists. She can feel them. And to her, they don't feel like weather. When the sun finally burns them away, they disappear too quickly. They retreat like a person running for safety. And they don't go indoors. A simple tent is enough to keep them out. It’s as if the mists understand that they are not welcome inside.
</Person2><Person1> She feels very alone with these thoughts. She wishes her friend TenSoon was there. He was a kandra, a very special creature, and he was always honest. She misses him very much. She sighs, and walks back into the busy camp. Elend finds her. After a quick kiss, he says she needs to do something with her koloss.
</Person1><Person2> A koloss is a huge, blue-skinned creature of incredible strength. Vin has learned to control one of them. This one follows her general orders, but she needs to concentrate to control it fully. Elend says it has been scaring the men. So, Vin goes to find it.
</Person2><Person1> And this is where our chapter ends. Vin is going to speak with this massive, frightening creature. And this koloss, whose name is Human, is about to tell her something. Something that will change everything she thinks she knows. He will tell her a secret about the mists… a secret that will confirm her deepest, darkest fears.
</Person1><Person2> What could a monster know about the mists? And how will it affect Vin? Join us next time to hear their strange and important conversation. Thank you for listening to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide.</Person2>
