<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2). I'm so glad you're here with me today.
Last time, we left Vin after a very strange talk. She spoke with a koloss named Human. He told her that the mists… the mists are an enemy. And Vin realized he was right. The mists were not her friend anymore. This is a big, and scary, new idea for her.
Today, we leave Vin for a little while. We are going to learn about something new. Something powerful… and dangerous.
The chapter starts by telling us about something called an Allomantic savant. Let’s think about that word. A savant. A savant is a person who has a very special, very strong skill. They practice this one skill so much that it changes them.
In our story, an Allomantic savant is a man or a woman who uses their metal power… a lot. They flare their metal for a long, long time. Flaring a metal means burning it very strongly. Doing this so much actually changes their body.
Mmm… can you imagine that? Using a power so much that your body itself becomes different? The book says this process changes their very physiology. Physiology is just a word for how a body works. So, the power changes how their bodies live and feel.
For some metals, the change is small. A person who burns bronze might not even know they are a savant. Their power just gets a little stronger. But for other metals… it is very different. And very dangerous. A person who burns pewter can become very strong. But if they become a pewter savant, they can push their body too hard and die, because they can’t feel pain.
But today, our story is about a tin savant. And a tin savant… is something special. Tin makes your senses stronger. You can see better, hear better, smell better. A tin savant flares their tin all the time. So their senses become… well, too strong. They become almost a slave to what they see and hear and touch. Everything is too much. But this also gives them a special advantage. A special power.
The book asks a question. Is a person like this still human? It’s an interesting thought, isn't it?
Now, let's meet our character for today. His name is Spook.
Spook woke up in darkness. Complete darkness. He had a blindfold on his face. It was tied very tight over his eyes and his ears. The cloth felt rough on his skin. But it was better than the other choice. For Spook, even the light from the stars is as bright as the sun. A person walking outside his room sounds like thunder.
You see, Spook is a tin savant.
Even with the thick cloth over his eyes, and wax in his ears, and cloths over the windows… it was still hard for him to sleep. The world is just too loud, and too bright.
Being like this is dangerous. He cannot see or hear his enemies easily. But not sleeping… that is even more dangerous. He needs his power to help the people in this city, Urteau. He worries he made the wrong choice to become a savant. But he made a choice, and he will continue.
He sits up in his bed. He groans a little. He takes off the blindfold and pulls the wax from his ears. The room is dark, but he can see. There is a very small amount of light coming through the window shutters. For him, it is enough.
He can feel the tin in his stomach. It burns all the time, even when he sleeps. His body just uses it now, like breathing. He needs more. He reaches for a small bucket and takes some tin dust. Tin is cheap, which is lucky for him. He puts the dust in a mug.
Now, he needs water. He closes his eyes very tight. Then, he opens his door.
(soft gasp) The light from the hallway is like a crash. It is so bright, it hurts, even with his eyes closed. He feels around on the floor and finds a jug of water. A servant leaves it for him every day. He pulls the jug inside his room and quickly shuts the door.
He walks across his small room and pours the water into his mug. He drinks it, washing down the tin. This will be enough for the whole day. But he takes a little extra, just in case. He puts it in a small pouch.
A few minutes later, he is dressed and ready. He sits on his bed and closes his eyes. He is preparing for the day. He knows that his friends are coming to Urteau. Before they arrive, he needs to learn as much as he can about this city.
He sits and thinks. He can feel everything. He feels the floor shake when people walk in other rooms. He can hear voices outside, people yelling and talking. He hears bells ringing far away. It is afternoon, so the mists are gone for now. This city, Urteau, gets a few hours of sunlight. It is enough for plants to grow.
Normally, Spook would sleep during the day. But today, he has things to do.
He opens his eyes. He picks up a pair of spectacles, or glasses. But these glasses are special. They do not help him see better. They are just pieces of clear glass. He puts them on.
Then, he does something clever. He ties the blindfold back around his head, but this time, it goes over the glasses. With the glasses on, he can open his eyes under the blindfold. He can see through the cloth. The cloth blocks just enough sunlight so he is not blind. But his senses are so strong, his mind can ignore the cloth. It’s almost like the cloth is invisible to him. It reminds him of the mists.
He nods to himself. He picks up his walking cane. And he leaves the room, ready for the city.
Spook has this incredible, but painful, power. He has made himself this way to help people. Now he is going out into a dangerous city.
And what he finds there… well. Next time, we will follow Spook into the city of Urteau. He will sit with another man, both of them pretending to be poor beggars. They will watch the city’s new leader, a man called the Citizen. And they will see that this new freedom in Urteau… is not freedom at all. It is something much darker. We will see what Spook’s incredible senses tell him about the truth of this place.
Thank you for listening. I will see you next time.</Person1>
