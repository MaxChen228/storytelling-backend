<Person1>Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings. Last time, Gaal was looking at the amazing city of Trantor from a high tower. He felt so small. But as he stood there, he realized he was not alone.
</Person1><Person1>He came away from the view feeling a little… empty. The man from the elevator, his new friend, pointed to a seat next to him. Gaal sat down. The man smiled warmly. "My name is Jerril," he said. "First time on Trantor?"
</Person1><Person1>Gaal nodded. "Yes, Mr. Jerril."
</Person1><Person1>Jerril laughed softly. "Just Jerril," he said. He explained that Trantor is a special place, especially for people with a "poetic temperament." But, he said, people born on Trantor never come up to these towers. They don't like it. It gives them nerves.
</Person1><Person1>"Nerves!" Gaal was surprised. "It's glorious!" (pause) Mmm, let's look at that word. Nerves. When something gives you nerves, it makes you feel anxious and worried (緊張). Can you imagine that? Being afraid of the open sky?
</Person1><Person1>Jerril explained. "If you're born in a small room, and grow up in a corridor, and work in a little cell... then coming out here with only sky above you... it can be terrifying." He said they make children come up once a year. But the children just scream. It doesn't seem to help.
</Person1><Person1>Then Jerril shared another secret. "How high up do you think we are?" he asked. Gaal guessed half a mile. Jerril chuckled. "No. Just five hundred feet."
</Person1><Person1>Gaal was confused. The elevator ride was so long. Jerril explained that most of Trantor is deep underground. It's like an iceberg. You only see the top part. The city goes down for more than a mile. It’s so deep that they use the planet's heat to create all the energy they need.
</Person1><Person1>Suddenly, Jerril’s friendly mood changed. His eyes looked… shrewd. "What do you think of it all?" he asked. Then, "Are you here on vacation?"
</Person1><Person1>Gaal felt a little uncomfortable. "Not exactly," he said. "I came here for a job. With Doctor Seldon's project."
</Person1><Person1>Jerril’s eyes narrowed. "You mean Hari Seldon? They call him Raven Seldon."
</Person1><Person1>Gaal had never heard this name. "Why?" he asked. Jerril leaned in a little. "Because he keeps predicting disaster."
</Person1><Person1>Disaster? Gaal was shocked. He only knew Seldon's work on mathematical theory. He felt annoyed and decided to leave. He said goodbye and went back to his hotel room.
</Person1><Person1>When he opened the door, a man was waiting for him inside. Gaal was too startled to speak. The man was old, with a kind face and very bright blue eyes. Before Gaal could ask who he was, the man said, "I am Hari Seldon."
</Person1><Person1>It was him. The famous scientist. Seldon explained that they needed to work quickly. Then he asked, "You were talking to a man on the observation tower, were you not?" Seldon told Gaal the truth. Jerril was not a friend. He was an agent of the Commission of Public Safety. He had been following Gaal since he arrived.
</Person1><Person1>Seldon confirmed what Jerril said. "I do predict disaster," he said. He wanted to show Gaal how. He took out his calculator pad. Its gray surface was worn from use. Seldon’s old fingers moved quickly, and red symbols glowed on the screen. "That represents the condition of the Empire at present," he said.
</Person1><Person1>Then, he started adding things. The probability of assassination. Revolts. Economic problems. With each new piece of information, the symbols on the screen changed and grew. The math became more and more complex.
</Person1><Person1>Finally, Seldon stopped. He looked at Gaal. "This is Trantor three centuries from now. How do you interpret that?"
</Person1><Person1>Gaal looked at the final equation. He couldn't believe it. "Total destruction!" he whispered. "But… that’s impossible."
</Person1><Person1>Seldon explained why. As Trantor becomes more specialized, it becomes more vulnerable. (pause) Let's stop on that word. Vulnerable. It means weak and easy to hurt (脆弱的). Trantor depends on other worlds for everything. If those connections are broken, the entire city-planet will fall.
</Person1><Person1>Seldon asked Gaal to calculate the exact probability of destruction. Gaal did the math in his head, sweating. "About 85%?" he guessed.
</Person1><Person1>"Not bad," Seldon said. "But not good. The actual figure is 92.5%."
</Person1><Person1>So now Gaal knows the terrible secret. This glorious, powerful city is doomed. Seldon's psychohistory proves it. This is why the government is watching them. But knowing the future is one thing; changing it is another. (pause) Next time, Gaal will learn that Seldon’s plans are far bigger, and more dangerous, than he ever imagined. Seldon predicted Gaal would be arrested… and that prediction is about to come true.
