Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings.
Hello again, and welcome back. (pause) Do you remember where we left our main character, Gaal? He was standing on a very tall tower. He was looking at the amazing city of Trantor. The city was so big it covered the entire planet. But Gaal was a little sad. He could not see the real sky, or any trees, or any grass. Only metal buildings, everywhere.
As he stood there, looking at everything, he felt a little… lost. His eyes were a little blank. Then, he saw the man from the elevator. The man who helped him. This man pointed to an empty seat next to him. So, Gaal went and sat down.
The man smiled. He was friendly. He said his name was Jerril. He asked Gaal, "First time on Trantor?" Gaal said yes. Jerril laughed a little. He said he knew it. He said Trantor is a special place for people with a poetic temperament. That means people who feel things very deeply, like artists or writers.
But then Jerril said something strange. He said people from Trantor, Trantorians, never come up to these high towers. They don't like it. He said it gives them nerves.
Mmm… let's stop here for a moment. Nerves (緊張). When something gives you "nerves," it makes you feel very worried, or scared, or anxious. Imagine you have to speak in front of a big group of people. You might feel your hands shake. That feeling is "nerves." So, the people of Trantor feel scared up here.
Gaal was very surprised. He said, "Nerves! Why? It's glorious!" He thinks the view is beautiful. But Jerril explained. Think about it. If you are born in a small room, a cubicle… and you grow up in a long, narrow hall, a corridor… and you work in a tiny office, a cell… then, suddenly coming out into a big open space with nothing above you… well, that would be very scary. Jerril said the children scream when they come up here for the first time.
So, the people of Trantor live their whole lives inside. They are happy there. They run the whole Empire from down below. It’s a completely different way of life, isn't it?
Jerril then asks Gaal a question. "How high up do you think we are?" Gaal guesses, "Half a mile?" He felt a little silly asking. And he was right to feel that way. Jerril laughed and said, "No. Just five hundred feet."
Gaal was confused. The elevator ride was so long! But Jerril explained that most of that ride was just to get to the ground level. Trantor is built deep, deep into the ground. It goes down for over a mile. He said it’s like an iceberg. You only see a small part on top. Most of it is hidden under the ground. It's an amazing idea, a city that is mostly underground.
Then, Jerril’s friendly mood changed. (pause) Suddenly, he didn't look so friendly anymore. He looked… sly. He asked Gaal, "What do you think of it all?" And then he asked, "Why are you here? For a vacation?"
Gaal felt a little uncomfortable. He said he was here for a job. A job with a man named Doctor Hari Seldon.
Jerril’s face became very serious. He asked, "You mean Raven Seldon?" Gaal was confused. He only knew Hari Seldon, the famous psychohistorian. Jerril explained that people call him "Raven" Seldon. It's a nickname. Why? "Because he keeps predicting disaster."
Here is our second important word. Predict (預測). To predict something is to say what you think will happen in the future. For example, a weather report predicts it will rain tomorrow. So, Hari Seldon predicts that something bad, a disaster, is going to happen.
Gaal was shocked. He is a mathematician. He read Seldon's work. It was all about math, not disaster. He felt annoyed by Jerril's strange questions. So, he said goodbye and left.
So, to recap this part. Gaal learns that the people of Trantor are afraid of open spaces. He also learns that his new boss, Hari Seldon, has a strange nickname, "Raven," because he predicts disaster. This is all very new and confusing for Gaal.
Now, imagine this next scene. Gaal goes back to his hotel room. He opens the door. And there is a man waiting for him inside. (pause) An old man, with bright blue eyes. Gaal is so startled he can't speak. Before Gaal can ask, "What are you doing here?" the man stands up and says, "I am Hari Seldon."
It was him! The famous Hari Seldon was right there, in Gaal's room. Gaal felt very confused. He wasn't supposed to meet him until tomorrow. Seldon explained that they must work quickly. He asked Gaal about the man on the tower, Jerril. Seldon told Gaal that Jerril was not just a friendly person. He was an agent, a spy, for the government. He had been following Gaal since he arrived.
Why? Seldon said it was because of his predictions. The prediction of disaster. Seldon then took out a small computer, a calculator pad. His fingers moved quickly. Red symbols appeared on the screen. "This," Seldon said, "represents the condition of the Empire right now."
He then added more information. He added the probability of leaders being killed, of planets fighting back, of economic problems. The equation on the screen grew and changed. It was complex, beautiful mathematics. Seldon showed Gaal the final result. He asked, "How do you interpret that?"
Gaal looked at the symbols. He could not believe what he was seeing. He said, "Total destruction! But… that is impossible."
Seldon was excited. He pushed Gaal to explain it in simple words. Gaal said that as Trantor gets bigger and more important, it also gets weaker. It becomes a prize for powerful families to fight over. And as they fight, they forget about taking care of the Empire.
Seldon then asked for the number. The probability. What is the chance of total destruction within three hundred years? Gaal did the math in his head. He was sweating. He guessed, "About 85%?"
Seldon looked at him. "Not bad," he said. "But the actual figure is 92.5%."
A 92.5% chance that this glorious, powerful city will be completely destroyed. This is Seldon's secret. This is why the government is watching him. This is why they are watching Gaal.
So, let's review. Gaal meets the real Hari Seldon. Seldon shows him a mathematical prediction. The prediction says the Galactic Empire will fall. Trantor will be destroyed. And the government knows about this prediction. They are watching Seldon and anyone who works with him. Gaal is now in the middle of a very dangerous situation.
And it gets worse. (pause) Just as Gaal is asking if Seldon is in danger, his new life on Trantor is turned upside down. The Commission of Public Safety, the government police, come and arrest Gaal. Seldon knew this would happen. In fact, he planned it. But why? And what will happen to Gaal now that he is a prisoner? We will find out next time.
