Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Sazed and his friends arrived in the city of Urteau, a place that hates nobles. They were immediately taken to meet the city’s leader, a man called “the Citizen.” Let’s join them now, as they step into his room.
Imagine a very large, very empty room. It was once part of a nobleman’s beautiful house, but now… it feels like a cold, white box. All the fine furniture and decorations are gone. Standing in this empty room is the leader, Quellion. He has short hair and rough skin. He was once a simple farmer, but he stands tall and strong. He has a military bearing… that’s the way a person stands and moves. He stands like a soldier, very straight and very serious.
Sazed, Breeze, and Allrianne are sitting on hard, wooden stools. Not very comfortable. And Quellion’s first words are not comfortable either. He looks at them and says, in a low, hard voice, “You aren’t wanted here.”
Mmm… a very unfriendly welcome. Sazed tries to be careful. He says, “I know you don’t want foreign soldiers in your city. But we are not here to conquer you. We only have two hundred men.”
But Quellion is not worried about the soldiers. He says, “It’s about the man who sent you.” He is talking about their king, Elend Venture. Quellion believes Elend is a bad person. He calls him a liar and a… tyrant. A tyrant is a ruler who is very cruel and unfair. A leader who doesn't listen to his people. Quellion thinks Elend forced other kings to follow him, using his powerful wife and his army of monsters.
Sazed tries to argue, but Quellion doesn't listen. The leader then turns to Sazed and asks a difficult question. He says that Sazed was friends with the Survivor, Kelsier. And Kelsier wanted to destroy all the nobles. “Doesn’t that strike you as inconsistent, Terrisman?” he asks. In other words, why are you now working for a nobleman like Elend?
Sazed says that Kelsier’s work was finished when the Lord Ruler died. Now, they need peace.
“Peace?” Quellion asks, with a small, bitter laugh. “Did you ever hear the Survivor speak of peace?”
Sazed has to be honest. “No,” he says quietly.
The room is very tense. Quellion then turns his attention to Breeze. He points at Breeze and tells everyone that he is a Soother. He says Breeze uses Allomancy, a kind of magic, to change people’s emotions. He even asks if Breeze used his magic to get his beautiful girlfriend, Allrianne.
But Breeze… well, Breeze is very clever. He just smiles and takes a drink of his wine. He says to Quellion, “My dear man… perhaps you should ask yourself why I manipulated you into saying what you just did.”
(soft laugh) Of course, it’s a trick. Breeze isn't controlling him. But now, Quellion will always wonder. He will always feel a little bit unsure. It was a very smart move.
Sazed tries again to make peace. He talks about the real dangers in the world. He says, “The mists are lingering longer… they are killing people. The ash falls perpetually.” Perpetually means it never stops. He explains that King Elend has better food, and he knows how to control the dangerous koloss. He is telling Quellion that it would be very smart to be friends with them.
But Quellion hears only threats. He believes Sazed is trying to scare him. He turns to his men and says, “You see? First peace, then threats.” He looks back at Sazed. “We are not worried about our future,” he says. “Because we follow the Survivor.” And then, he tells them to go. “Be gone from my sight.”
The meeting is over. It was not a success. But as they stand to leave, Sazed asks one more thing. He asks if they can please stay in the city for a while. He promises they will not cause any trouble.
Quellion is not happy about it. But he waves his hand and agrees. “Stay if you must,” he warns, “but do not make trouble.” And with that, Sazed and his friends retreat from the cold, empty room.
So, they are allowed to stay, but they are not welcome. They are in a city of enemies, with a leader who hates their king. What can they do now? Next time, they will explore the city of Urteau. And they will meet someone they know… but this person has changed. He is mysterious, wearing a blindfold, and he seems to have a secret plan for them.
