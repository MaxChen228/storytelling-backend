<Person1> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, Sazed and Breeze tried to talk with the city’s leader, Quellion. But Quellion did not want to be friends with their emperor, Elend. He told them to leave. Sazed said they would stay in the city, peacefully. Now, they are leaving Quellion’s building, and they are not sure what to do next.
</Person1><Person1> Let’s join them as they get back into their carriage. Can you picture the city around them? It is not a happy place. Breeze sits down and looks out the window. He says, “Well… murderous revolutionaries, gray clothing, and burned buildings. This is a lovely place.”
</Person1><Person1> Mmm… do you think he really means it’s a lovely place? No, of course not. He is being <lang xml:lang="en-US">sarcastic. That is when you say the opposite of what you feel. He thinks the city is actually quite terrible. Sazed tries to smile, but he doesn’t feel happy. He is worried.
</Person1><Person1> Breeze tells Sazed not to look so <lang xml:lang="en-US">grim, which means so serious and sad. Breeze thinks Quellion is not as dangerous as he looks. He believes they can convince him to be their friend… eventually. But Sazed is not so sure. He tells Breeze, “This place is different.” The leaders here are not desperate. And the people… the people are very <lang xml:lang="en-US">subservient. That means they obey the leaders without asking questions. Sazed thinks their work here will be very, very difficult.
</Person1><Person1> So, we have Breeze, who is hopeful, and Sazed, who is worried. They are in a dark, sad city, and they have no friends here. It feels like a very difficult situation.
</Person1><Person1> Suddenly, Allrianne points to something outside. “Breezy, do you see that?” she asks. Everyone looks. Outside, in a courtyard, a group of people are standing around a huge fire. A big, big bonfire. Black smoke goes up into the gray sky. Sazed squints his eyes to see better. What are they burning?
</Person1><Person1> One of their soldiers, walking next to the carriage, tells them. He says they are burning tapestries and furniture. A <lang xml:lang="en-US">tapestry is a beautiful cloth picture you hang on a wall. These are expensive things that belonged to the nobility, the rich families from before. The soldier says the burning was <lang xml:lang="en-US">staged for your benefit.
</Person1><Person1> Mmm… that’s an interesting phrase. Staged for your benefit. What does that mean? It means the fire was not a real, spontaneous event. It was a show, like a play in a theater. Quellion, the city’s leader, planned it. He wanted Sazed and Breeze to see it. He wanted to show them how much he hated the nobility. It was all done for them.
</Person1><Person1> Sazed finds this very strange. How does this simple soldier know so much? He looks at the soldier more closely. The man is wearing a hood to protect himself from the falling ash. But there is something else. The soldier has a thick bandage, a blindfold, tied across his eyes. It looks like he cannot see. And yet… Sazed recognizes his face.
</Person1><Person1> Then, Breeze shouts with a happy voice, “Spook, my dear boy!” It is their old friend, Spook! He has found them. But why is he wearing a blindfold? Breeze asks him, but Spook does not answer the question. He just looks back at the fire. Sazed thinks the cloth must be thin, so Spook can see through it. It’s the only explanation. Spook moves so easily, not like a blind person at all.
</Person1><Person1> So, a mystery has appeared. Their friend Spook is here, but he is different. He is wearing a blindfold and he is not explaining why. This is a big surprise, a moment of discovery in the sad, gray city.
</Person1><Person1> Spook turns to them and gets right to business. He asks if they have a place to stay, a base of operations. Breeze says they thought about staying at an inn. But Spook tells them there are no inns in the city. The leader, Quellion, says citizens should just let visitors stay in their homes. Breeze suggests maybe they will have to camp outside the city walls.
</Person1><Person1> But Spook shakes his head. “No,” he says. “Follow me.” And just like that, everything changes. They were lost, with no plan and no place to go. Now, their mysterious, blindfolded friend has a plan. He is leading them somewhere. Where could he be taking them? And what secrets is he hiding behind that blindfold?
</Person1><Person1> It seems Spook will lead them to an old, abandoned Ministry building. Inside, he will show them a secret that will change everything—a hidden treasure left by the old Lord Ruler. But getting this treasure will not be easy, not with Quellion controlling the city. What they find will be bigger and more important than they can imagine. We will discover it all next time.</Person1>
