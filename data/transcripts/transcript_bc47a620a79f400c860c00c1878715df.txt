Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2).
Last time, we left TenSoon in a very difficult place. He was going back to his people to be punished. He told his friend MeLaan that he was ready to accept it. But… he had a secret hope. A small chance to escape, connected to the dog bones Vin gave him.
Today, we leave that tense moment and join Vin and Elend on their journey.
Imagine this. A long, thin boat is moving slowly down a canal. The world around it is quiet and grey. Ash falls from the sky, covering the dark water. Giant, blue-skinned creatures called koloss walk along the path next to the canal. They are pulling the boats with thick ropes.
Vin sits on top of the boat’s cabin. She quietly watches Elend. He stands at the very front of the boat, looking west. He looks like a king. His back is straight, and he looks very determined. But… he also looks tired. His white uniform is clean, but it is not new anymore. It is the uniform of a man who has been at war for two years.
Vin knows him very well. She can feel that he is worried about something. But she also knows that he doesn't want to talk about it right now. So, she gives him space. She picks up a book and sits down to read.
It is a very old book. A logbook, written a thousand years ago by a man named Alendi. He believed he was the Hero of Ages. Vin opens the book to a page she has marked. She reads a certain paragraph again and again. The words say, "The Deepness must be destroyed." Alendi wrote that this Deepness was not just a thing, but a living being with a mind.
Mmm… this feels very familiar to Vin. She thinks about the mists. She remembers what a friend told her… that the mists hate her. She has felt that hatred herself. It seems Alendi felt it too, a thousand years ago.
But here is the big problem. Can she even trust the words in this book? She knows that the evil force she released from the Well of Ascension… the being she calls Ruin… can change things. It can change the words written in a book. So maybe the whole book is a lie, changed by Ruin to trick her.
Vin feels like she has been a puppet, you know? Pulled by invisible strings. For three years, she thought she was making great discoveries. But maybe… she was just following Ruin's plan all along.
She feels so alone with this problem. Her friend Sazed is too sad to study anymore. TenSoon has returned to his people. And Elend is too busy being a king and a general. That leaves Vin. And Vin has never been a scholar. A scholar, that is a person who loves to study and learn from books. Vin has always been a person of action, a fighter. Reading books is boring for her.
But she is changing. She knows she must do what is necessary, even if she doesn't like it. So, she thinks of her first teacher, Kelsier. He always said, "There's always another secret." Kelsier taught her how to take a huge, impossible task and break it down. To change it into small, manageable pieces.
Okay, Vin thinks. I will begin like Kelsier. I will list the things I know for certain.
One: The power at the Well of Ascension was real. She felt it.
Two: Something was alive and trapped there. A being called Ruin.
Three: Ruin tricked her, and she used the power to set it free.
Four: Ruin can change written words.
It is not much, but it is a start. She is thinking, tapping her finger on the book. And then, she has an idea.
“Elend?” she calls out.
He turns. “What is the first rule of Allomancy?” she asks him. “The first thing I taught you?”
“Consequence,” Elend says.
Let’s think about that word for a moment. Consequence. A consequence is what happens after an action. It is the result of what you do. Elend explains it. When you use Allomancy to Push on something heavy, it pushes you back. That is a consequence. For every action, there is a reaction.
Elend says that is why he likes Allomancy. It is not magic. It is rational. It follows rules, like a thing of nature. You drop a rock, it falls. You Push something, it Pushes back. There are no exceptions.
And as Vin listens, something clicks in her mind.
A thing of nature. For every Push, there is a Pull. A consequence.
She looks out at the grey world, and she has a powerful new thought. Maybe Ruin is not just a monster of pure chaos. Maybe Ruin also follows rules. Maybe it has a logic. She doesn't understand the rules yet… but if there are rules, then Ruin is not all-powerful. If it has rules, it can be understood. And maybe… it can be beaten.
Vin has found a new way forward. Not with her knives, but with her mind. She must solve the puzzle of Ruin.
But as Vin finds this new strength, Elend is struggling. He is a king, but he is afraid he is becoming like the evil Lord Ruler they fought so hard to destroy. He is making difficult decisions, sacrificing people for the "greater good," and he worries this path is making him a tyrant.
What hard choices must a king make? And can Elend lead his people without losing himself? We will find out next time. Thank you for listening.</Person1>
