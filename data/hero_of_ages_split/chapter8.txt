That is an indisputably depressing event.” Elend shook his head. “We can survive this. But, the only way that will happen is if our people don’t give up. They need leaders who laugh, leaders who feel that this fight can be won. So, this is what I ask of you. I don’t care if you’re an optimist or a pessimist—I don’t care if secretly, you think we’ll all be dead before the month ends. On the outside, I want to see you smiling. Do it in defiance, if you have to. If the end does come, I want this group to meet that end smiling. As the Survivor taught us.” Slowly, the members of the former crew nodded—even Sazed, though his face seemed troubled. Cett just shook his head. “You people are all insane. How I ended up with you, I’ll never know.” Breeze laughed. “Now, that’s a lie, Cett. You know exactly how you ended up joining with us. We threatened to kill you if you didn’t!” Elend was looking at Vin. She met his eyes, and nodded. It had been a good speech. She wasn’t certain if his words would change anything—the crew could never again be the way it had been at the beginning, laughing freely around Clubs’s table in the evening hours. However, maybe if they kept Kelsier’s smile in mind, they’d be less likely to forget just why it was they kept struggling on. “All right, people,” Elend finally said. “Let’s start preparations. Breeze, Sazed, Allrianne—I’ll need you to talk with the scribes about supply estimates for your trip. Ham, send word to Luthadel and tell Penrod to have our scholars work on culturing plants that can grow in very little sunlight. Demoux, pass the word to the men. We march tomorrow.”
