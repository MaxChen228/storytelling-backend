Breeze, Sazed, and Allrianne arrive in Urteau, a grim revolutionary city. Breeze jokes, but Sazed feels unease, noting the subservient populace and leader Quellion's un-desperate nature.

They observe a bonfire of noble goods, revealed by a soldier as a staged display. Sazed recognizes the soldier as Spook, mysteriously blindfolded and tense. Spook, surprisingly informed, dismisses their plans for an inn or camping, insisting he will lead them. Where will Spook lead them, and what secrets does he hide?
