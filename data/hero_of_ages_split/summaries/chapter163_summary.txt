She effortlessly dispatches foes, ripping out their spikes, as Marsh watches, stunned by her power. Her Pushes and Pulls feel like duralumin, allowing her to dominate the battlefield.

She unleashes a massive Push, blasting out of the mists into the star-filled sky, seeing them swirl below in a vast whirlpool. Falling back, she feels the mists surge, drawn into her. Back in Luthadel, Vin confronts the remaining Inquisitors at Kredik Shaw.
