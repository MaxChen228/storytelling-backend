Elend, Vin, and Fatren discover a vast cavern of vital supplies. Elend immediately claims the city and its contents, asserting he came to conquer, not rob. Fatren protests, insisting it belongs to his people.

Elend, battling his idealism, explains that without his army's protection, the cavern's wealth invites chaos. He offers stability and protection under his rule, stressing cooperation is vital for survival. Convinced, Fatren agrees.

Vin observes Elend's transformation into a pragmatic, forceful leader. Elend struggles, feeling like a failure for abandoning his ideals, but Vin reminds him emperors lack such luxuries. He faces difficult choices.
