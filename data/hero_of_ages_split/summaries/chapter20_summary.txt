The group travels into the Central Dominance, where Elend organizes skaa to cultivate food for winter. Sazed despairs, seeing weak crops dwarfed by ash and questioning if anything has truly changed for the skaa. Captain Goradel, however, finds hope in their labor, explaining that unlike under the Lord Ruler, these skaa now work for their own survival and families, giving their efforts new meaning.

Sazed soon departs, heading alone to the Pits of Hathsin, Kelsier's birthplace. He discovers it is now home to the surviving Terris people, who have transformed the former prison camp into pastoral villages. Adapting to the ash-covered land, they herd resilient sheep, living a life surprisingly easier than most. As Sazed approaches, Terris elders greet him with reverence, calling him "Your Majesty." Sazed's unexpected title hints at a significant new role for him among his people.
