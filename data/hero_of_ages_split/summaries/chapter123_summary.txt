The soldiers guarding the Ministry building suddenly vanish, sparking concern among Sazed, Spook, and Breeze. Spook quickly seizes the opportunity, integrating their own forces into the plan against Quellion and dispatching scouts. Sazed observes Spook's surprising growth as a decisive leader, a stark contrast to his quiet past, yet notes the lingering mystery of his bandaged eyes.

As Sazed works on engineering projects, he grapples with profound despair, witnessing the world's accelerating decay: heavier ashfalls, violent earthquakes. Spook reveals the soldiers left to quell city-wide riots, a development he sees as an advantage, but Sazed fears their actions push the city to the brink. Sazed confronts Spook about his optimism, admitting his own loss of faith. Spook confesses his doubts but then shares a newfound understanding of faith: a trust that someone is watching, that things will be made right, and that there will always be a way.

Sazed realizes this profound sense of trust is precisely what he has lost.
