Sazed, convinced Vin is the Hero of Ages, faces KanPaar's coup. Fifth and Second Generation kandra storm the Trustwarren, seizing Sazed and the First Generation. KanPaar accuses Haddek of instability and threatening their people with the "Resolution," asserting his desire for firm, immutable leadership.

Sazed warns that disrupting the kandra's prophetic role risks inadvertently causing the end of all things. Gagged and dragged away, Sazed leaves the atium with the traitors. The kandra's future, and perhaps the world's, now rests on KanPaar's dangerous ambition.
