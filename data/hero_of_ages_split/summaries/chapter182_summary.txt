Elend holds atium in the Trustwarren as a koloss army approaches. Sazed insists Vin, the Hero of Ages, will arrive, but Elend feels impotent. His small army is no match, and he considers giving the atium back to the god. General Demoux confirms their grim reality: few soldiers, no Allomancers, and multiple entrances to guard. Despair settles as Demoux admits they will die.

Suddenly, Elend realizes Demoux’s "sick" soldiers might be atium Mistings. Their prolonged illness, combined with Yomen’s Misting, suggests one in sixteen could be. He orders Demoux to eat a bead. Demoux’s eyes widen, and Elend smiles, realizing this discovery promises a powerful, unexpected defense.
