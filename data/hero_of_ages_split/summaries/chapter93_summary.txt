Vin descends into the Canton of Resource basement, seeking a hidden cache of atium and the Lord Ruler's vital information. Her tin-enhanced senses guide her through dark, musty corridors, where she detects patrolling guards. She subtly employs Brass and Zinc, Soothing and Rioting the soldiers' emotions to create distractions and slip past them, reflecting on her brother Reen's survival lessons versus her evolving, more trusting approach.

Deeper within the extensive basement, Vin encounters more heavily guarded sections. She strategically uses a powerful duralumin-enhanced emotional burst to incite an argument among distant guards, drawing most of the immediate threats away. She then quickly dispatches the remaining two with a targeted Riot of curiosity, clearing her path to a hidden trapdoor. Descending into pitch darkness, she lights a lantern, revealing a massive, forced-open stone door leading into the cache. She realizes Yomen must have known about this and deliberately breached it.

As Vin steps inside, the heavy stone door slams shut behind her, trapping her in the silent cavern. Now isolated and vulnerable, Vin must confront the immediate danger of her confinement and uncover the secrets within.
