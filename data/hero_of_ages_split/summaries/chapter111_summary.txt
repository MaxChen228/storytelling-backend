Elend battles koloss in a burning village, his rage fueled by destruction and perceived inadequacy, feeling his powerful Allomancy is futile against the overwhelming numbers. He struggles to control the koloss, suspecting an Inquisitor, but they resist his emotional Pushes. Saving a father and daughter, he understands Vin's past ruthlessness and the desperate need for power to protect, realizing his scholarly approach is insufficient.

Driven by the villagers' desperate hope, Elend embraces the desire to kill, burning duralumin and zinc to Push with all his might. Thousands of koloss fall silent, under his control. However, the suspected Inquisitor is nowhere to be found, leaving Elend wary. His victory feels hollow; the village is in ruins, and he hasn't truly saved it. Mistaken for the Lord Ruler, Elend turns to his waiting army, realizing the time for killing has only just begun.
