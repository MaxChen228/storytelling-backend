Ruin subtly influences individuals via Hemalurgic spikes, though mental fortitude can mitigate this. Sazed, in the kandra homeland, meticulously stacks his metal notes, growing frustrated. The Terris religion, centered on Preservation and scholarship, seems disappointingly unoriginal, offering no unique hope or proof of Tindwyl's survival. His quest for truth feels stalled.

Feeling betrayed, Sazed shifts his study from abstract doctrines to the people who believed. He realizes faith isn't about grand ideals but the "simple magic" in everyday life—miracles seen through a trusting lens. He recalls TenSoon's timely words as a personal sign, understanding belief is ultimately a choice, not forced conviction.

Sazed decides to embrace faith, not from undeniable proof, but because he *chooses* to believe, like Vin trusted Kelsier. With renewed purpose, he prepares to meet the First Generation kandra, eager to investigate the First Contract, a document he believes only he and the Lord Ruler have read.
