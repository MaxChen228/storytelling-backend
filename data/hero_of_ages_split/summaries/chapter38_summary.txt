In Urteau, Spook gathers intelligence for Elend, learning Quellion's policies in a tavern. Whispers reveal plans to abolish coins, centralize wealth, resembling the Lord Ruler. Crucially, genealogists trace lineages back five generations, seeking noble blood to divide the populace. Only the "pure" will serve, creating a market for hiding pasts.

Spook discovers pewter prevents intoxication, enhancing resilience. Reflecting on his past as a "nobody," Kelsier's voice urges greatness. Inspired, Spook resolves to bring Urteau into Elend's empire, flaring pewter and tin to reveal enhanced speed and strength, embracing his potential.

As Spook's resolve solidifies, he realizes he's been recognized by men who saw him "run through" and know he's from the Survivor's crew, thanks to Durn. The eerie silence confirms his identity is known. Spook quickly flees into the night.
