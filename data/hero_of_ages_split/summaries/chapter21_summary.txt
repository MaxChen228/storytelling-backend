Spook awakens in a burning nobleman's house, severely wounded and disoriented. His senses are dulled, body weak from blood loss, and he's out of tin. A familiar, yet unidentifiable, voice urges him to escape the encroaching flames, promising revenge. Spook trusts the voice, crawling despite his pain and useless arm, struggling to navigate a world without his enhanced senses.

Guided by the voice, Spook reaches a study and finds vials. He drinks one, hoping for tin, but discovers a new, unexpected metal reserve. The voice commands him to "Burn it!" and Spook ignites pewter, a metal he shouldn't possess. Instantly, his body flares with strength, weakness vanishes, and he leaps to his feet, his wounds no longer debilitating.

A dark, commanding figure steps from the flames, revealing Kelsier. He confirms bestowing pewter upon Spook, not just for survival, but for revenge. Kelsier instructs Spook to use his newfound strength to escape onto the roof. Empowered by a ghost from the past, Spook must now embrace a new, violent purpose.
