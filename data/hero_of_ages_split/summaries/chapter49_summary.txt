Sazed, Spook, and Breeze discover a vast cavern. Spook immediately plans it as a highly defensible base for troops and supplies, noting its easily guarded entrance. Breeze feels safer.

As they descend, Sazed hears water, and Spook mentions "each cache has a specialty." They soon reveal an enormous underground lake; Breeze realizes it's the canals' source. This cavern promises both security and vital resources, hinting at the true purpose of these hidden caches.
