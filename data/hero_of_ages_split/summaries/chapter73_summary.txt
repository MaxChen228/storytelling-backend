Despite her growing Allomantic power, Vin feels anxious after battle. She observes the koloss camp: emotionless warriors ignore wounds, ritually flaying their dead. Human, a massive koloss, laments their dwindling numbers and unused swords. When Vin suggests children, Human demands *she* give them more, hinting at a secret he finds "not right" to reveal.

Intrigued, Vin nudges him Allomantically. Human screams, grabs a koloss corpse, and charges towards Elend’s camp, heading for the wounded. Vin follows, preventing interference. Inside, Human rips the skin from the corpse, revealing small metal spikes embedded within. Vin realizes these spikes hold the koloss skin in place.

Human then approaches a wounded soldier, spikes in hand. Vin, horrified, stops him, understanding the terrible truth: koloss are not born, but created by spiking humans. Human confirms her dawning realization, quietly stating, "I am human." Listeners will now grapple with the horrifying implications of this discovery.
