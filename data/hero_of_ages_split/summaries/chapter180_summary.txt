Soldiers excitedly report seeing Kelsier, with Demoux confirming the descriptions, suggesting the Survivor watches over them. However, a messenger brings dire news: koloss are rapidly approaching, threatening to arrive before night's end. Distracted, Elend feels a mysterious pull, hearing Vin's voice urging him to "Come." Ignoring Demoux's protests, he follows the unseen guidance into the ash-choked darkness.

Elend discovers a hidden cave entrance, leading to a vast cavern filled with strange, rock-boned mistwraiths. Deeper inside, he finds Sazed struggling to hold shut massive metal doors. As Sazed loses control, angry kandra burst forth, but Elend and Demoux quickly subdue them. Sazed reveals this is the kandra Homeland and the Lord Ruler's long-lost atium hoard.

Elend, however, dismisses the atium as worthless to his starving people. Instead, he sees the multiple vast caverns as a potential refuge from the scorching sun and the approaching koloss. With time running out, Elend immediately orders his soldiers to prepare to move their people into the newly discovered sanctuary. They must act quickly to ensure their survival.
