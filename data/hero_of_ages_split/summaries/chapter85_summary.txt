Rashek's past attempts to fix the world only worsened it, altering plants to be less nutritious and humanity to survive the ash sickness. Elend and Vin examine a defeated Inquisitor. Vin notes its impossible speed, dismissing Elend's duralumin theory, then reveals an extra pewter spike through its heart—a new, unexplained power beyond standard Allomancy.

Vin believes the "thing" from the Well of Ascension directs the Inquisitors, manipulating events and knowing their plans. Elend offers hope, but Vin highlights their dwindling numbers, the growing Deepness, and the world's decay. Despite capturing a koloss army, their victory feels hollow as Elend, a follower of the Church of the Survivor, clings to the commandment: Survive.

Vin takes control of a koloss, and Elend presents the new koloss army to Lord Fatren, framing it as a victory for his men. The mystery of the Inquisitors' true power and the entity manipulating them continues to loom large.
