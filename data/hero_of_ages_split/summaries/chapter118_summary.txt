The ancient pact between Preservation and Ruin is revealed: Preservation sacrifices part of his soul to grant mankind sentience, knowing this inherent weakness will eventually allow Ruin to destroy all creation. This bargain, ensuring independent thought, was eventually broken by Preservation.

Vin awakens, bound in silver manacles, her Allomantic metals purged by drugs. Chained to a bench, she faces the obligator king, Yomen. He details her immense danger, explaining his precautions: metal-free water and unburnable silver restraints. Vin, craving metal, suspects Allomancy's addictive nature. Yomen returns her mother's earring, a seemingly useless trinket, testing her. Wary of his motives and his atium bead, Vin suspects he might be a Mistborn trying to provoke her.

Despite her suspicions, Vin makes no move, realizing the earring holds no secret power, only comfort. Yomen, calm and calculating, then reveals his true intention. An unarmed soldier in Elend's livery enters, as Ruin's voice whispers to Vin to kill them all. Yomen warns Vin that any unauthorized speech will result in the soldier's execution. A tense negotiation now looms.
