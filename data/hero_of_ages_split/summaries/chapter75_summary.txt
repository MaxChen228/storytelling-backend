Sazed and Breeze sit in a bustling Urteau skaa bar, a sight that puzzles Sazed. He notes the skaa's newfound fearlessness in the mists, a stark contrast to their ingrained superstitions. Breeze attributes this to the Lord Ruler's absence and alcohol, but Sazed suspects the growing influence of Kelsier's Church of the Survivor. Breeze, having built local contacts, now openly introduces Sazed, whose Terris identity is unmistakable.

Breeze leads Sazed to a group of skeptical skaa miners. They distrust Soothers but respect Terrismen, questioning Sazed about Elend Venture's intentions for Urteau. Sazed explains Elend's desire for the city's resources and his commitment to better governance, contrasting him with Straff. The miners, however, hint at another solution: the "Survivor of the Flames," who they believe will deal with Quellion. Sazed, initially thinking of Kelsier, learns this is a new, different Survivor.

Intrigued by this figure deemed worthy of Kelsier's stature, Sazed presses for an introduction. The miners reveal that Quellion is holding public executions near Marketpit tomorrow, suggesting Sazed attend if he wishes to find this mysterious new Survivor.
