Allomancy requires "Snapping" through trauma, a process Preservation's mists initiated and Ruin amplified, leading to the Deepness. Vin confronts swirling black mist, as soldiers evacuate people to safety. Vin feels immense power but can only stall, buying time before Ruin's koloss arrive.

Ruin mocks her, revealing his true strength: hundreds of thousands of koloss from her people, marching on Luthadel. Vin realizes their overwhelming numbers and environmental devastation mean they are outmatched. Despair turns to hatred, realizing Ruin's centuries-long plan.

Refusing to humanize it, Vin launches a desperate attack. Their powers clash, threatening dissolution. Ruin recoils, surprised. Vin pulls back, injured, realizing their powers are equally matched—opposite yet similar. Ruin whispers of "Opposition, Balance." This opposition hints at a deeper, cosmic struggle Vin must now navigate.
