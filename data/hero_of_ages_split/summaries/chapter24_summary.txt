Demoux survives the sickness as Vin observes Elend, now a hardened king, resolute yet burdened at their narrowboat's prow. Vin senses his unspoken troubles. She rereads Alendi’s logbook, a passage describing "The Deepness" as a terrible, sentient entity the mists hate, noting its chilling parallels to her own quest and betrayal at the Well.

Vin grapples with the logbook's reliability, knowing Ruin alters texts, and feels manipulated by the entity she released. Yet, she realizes Ruin isn't omnipotent and cannot read her thoughts, offering hope. With others preoccupied, Vin reluctantly embraces scholarship, determined to unravel Ruin's puzzle. She lists knowns: the Well's power was real, Ruin was imprisoned, it tricked her, and it altered texts.

Vin senses Ruin acts with a destructive need but not randomly; it plans and follows specific rules. She asks Elend the first rule of Allomancy. He replies, "Consequence: Every action has consequences. For every Push, there is a Pull." Vin connects this fundamental law to Ruin's actions, recognizing a hidden logic she must now decipher. The nature of these "consequences" remains a dangerous mystery.
