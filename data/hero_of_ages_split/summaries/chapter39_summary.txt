Vin infiltrates Fadrex City under the cover of night, her Allomancy and stealth skills honed. She notes the mists now repel her, a gradual change. Barefoot and silent, she navigates past guards, burning bronze to confirm no Allomancers are present—a key weakness for Lord Yomen. She observes Fadrex is larger than Elend anticipated, with noble keeps and skaa slums, showing no immediate signs of the struggle Elend hoped for.

From the rooftops, Vin reflects on her past: her childhood with Reen, her time with Kelsier's crew, and attending balls as Valette Renoux. She grapples with how that "pretended" identity fits her true self. Though she loves Elend, she feels a bittersweet nostalgia for the crew's simpler, innocent days, before the burdens of leadership and the world's weight fell upon her.

Her fears now center on the empire's future, worrying what will happen if she fails to uncover the crucial secrets she seeks. She continues reconnaissance, gathering preliminary information on fortifications and living conditions for Ham and Demoux. Her mission to gather intelligence is just beginning, but the true challenge lies in the secrets she must uncover.
