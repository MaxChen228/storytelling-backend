Elend rides through his camp, facing Cett's blunt criticism for entering the besieged city. Cett argues Elend's compassion, sparked by interacting with citizens, is a dangerous weakness for a general. Elend acknowledges the internal war between protecting people and ruthless pragmatism, but defends his choice, believing his challenge lies in managing compassion, not suppressing it.

They strategize the siege: Elend agrees to poison the city's wells but insists on leaving a message, aiming to worry the populace into demanding water from Yomen, depleting his reserves. He orders harassment of surrounding villages to create an illusion of collapse. Cett warns Elend he cannot play "halfway" forever; a direct attack will eventually be necessary. An increasingly frequent earthquake interrupts them. Inside, Cett expresses deep concern over Luthadel's silence and lack of supplies, stressing Elend has only months to break Yomen's resolve. Elend reassures Cett about Allrianne's safety, hinting at Cett's hidden affections. Demoux then arrives, pale but recovering, confirming the army's generals are nearly back to full strength. With his army recovering and time running out, Elend must soon decide how far he will compromise his compassion to win the siege.
