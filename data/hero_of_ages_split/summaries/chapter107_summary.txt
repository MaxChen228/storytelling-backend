A nervous Beldre arrives at the crew's embassy, pleading for her brother Quellion's life, believing they intend to kill him. Spook confirms this truth despite Breeze's denials. Beldre explains Quellion's deep distrust, as he thinks the crew merely capitalized on the Survivor's popularity, yet she trusts them, recalling their past heroic deeds.

The crew quickly discerns Beldre as terrified, naive, and noble. Spook reveals his cunning strategy: he holds Beldre captive, spreading rumors of her desertion to seek their protection. Horrified, Beldre realizes she is a political pawn, but Spook justifies his deceit, believing the Survivor would approve.

Sazed observes Spook's newfound ruthlessness, wondering how Quellion reacts to his sister's capture. This bold move sets the stage for direct confrontation.
