Spook, feeling like a bystander, explains his Urteau mission: manage rebellion and investigate discoveries for Elend and Vin. He enjoys the purpose, despite his self-doubt, and describes Elend as a forgetful scholar and Vin as a fascinating, frightening force. Beldre, surprisingly trusting, pleads with Spook not to kill her brother and to save the city, which he promises to attempt.

She cautions him against wishing for power, having seen its corrupting influence on her brother. Spook acknowledges her wisdom, then rises, declaring he must now "be seen." He prepares to confront the city's challenges.
