Ruin is intelligent decay, a planning force. Vin and Elend lead villagers from Vetitan, facing a terrible choice as the mists, now appearing by day, randomly kill but grant immunity. Vin feels like a murderer, hating the mists Kelsier promised would be an ally, as they cause seizures and death among terrified villagers, leaving her powerless. Elend remains pragmatic, explaining to Lord Fatren that this forced exposure is a necessary "inoculation" to save them from a slower death in their dying, mist-covered village, as they must reach the Central Dominance for survival. Vin struggles with their brutal decision, but Elend insists they are "the kind we have to be."

As ash falls, Elend orders the dead buried by koloss and promises the living safety from future mist attacks. The wounded will be carried and eventually barged. The journey north continues, but the cost of survival weighs heavily on Vin.
