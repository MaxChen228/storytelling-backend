Spook secures Durn's loyalty, promising him primary trade contracts and an imperial title. Durn agrees to dam off the Harrows, preparing to flood the canals at night, with Spook emphasizing the critical need to protect the beggar population. With this alliance, Spook tours the city's bars, distributing stolen wine and listening to grievances. Emulating Kelsier, he projects quiet strength, quickly earning adoration as the "Survivor of the Flames." His confidence soars, connecting him to Kelsier's legacy and his own destiny to lead.

Despite the adulation, Spook battles mental fatigue and the moral weight of his growing power. He reflects on his captive, Beldre, fearing he might become a tyrant like Quellion. Yet, a voice, seemingly Kelsier's, whispers encouragement, affirming his worthiness. Spook accepts the cheers, seeing this respect as his escape from a past of insignificance, embracing the man he is becoming. The city now awaits the dramatic flooding of its canals.
