Elend arrives at Fadrex City, noting its defiant fires, and meets with Ham, Cett, and Vin. Scouts report Yomen holds the city with twenty-five thousand defenders, but a larger force maintains his kingdom. Cett explains Yomen's clever strategy allows a long siege while controlling other cities. Elend orders increased patrols and plans to bait Yomen into a raid by feigning fear of the mists.

Cett suggests attacking surrounding, unfortified cities for resources, but Elend refuses. His primary focus is the Lord Ruler's storage cache, believing it holds a vital secret—a "hope" against widespread crop failures from ash and mists. Cett dismisses the cache as a sadist's puzzle, advocating for pragmatic land acquisition.

Elend, however, remains resolute. He is convinced the Lord Ruler left something crucial for survival within the cache. The fate of his people hinges on what lies hidden inside Fadrex City.
