Breeze wistfully longs for green plants, a stark contrast to the ash-choked world, revealing his evolving, more compassionate nature. Sazed, battling deep despair, rejects simple belief. His rigorous study of religions leads him to conclude the Larsta faith, with its focus on beauty, is directly contradicted by the world's insipid reality. He writes "Religion not true," solidifying his commitment to truth over comforting lies, even as he struggles with melancholy and the burden of providing faith.

A scout reports the emperor's army is less than an hour away. Suddenly, Allrianne arrives, a vibrant splash of pink and gold against the ash, riding with surprising mastery. She playfully interacts with Breeze, subtly Rioting Sazed, highlighting her brazen use of power. Their affectionate, unconventional relationship prompts Sazed to reflect on the breakdown of social structures like marriage in a dying world.

Observing the world's decay and the struggling Church of the Survivor, Sazed reaffirms his conviction: he cannot teach lies, even if people desperately need faith, refusing to be a hypocrite who serves up beliefs he doesn't hold. The imminent arrival of the emperor's army promises a swift change of pace.
