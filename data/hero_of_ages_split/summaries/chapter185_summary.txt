Marsh confronts Elend, revealing he found atium as his koloss overrun Elend's forces. Elend's metals dwindle; Marsh claims Vin is dead. Suddenly, Elend feels a surge of phantom power, allowing him to fight with renewed strength. He sees a radiant vision of Vin above him, her presence empowers him. Burning his last atium with duralumin, Elend gains a flash of profound knowledge.

In a simultaneous strike, Elend pierces Marsh's neck, but Marsh's axe buries in Elend's chest. Marsh heals as Elend collapses, bleeding out. Marsh gloats, revealing his koloss now rampage through the kandra caverns and Elend has lost. With his dying breath, Elend defiantly reveals his true victory: his men burned all of Ruin's body—the atium—to prevent Marsh and his master from ever claiming it.

Marsh screams in fury as Elend smiles, having sacrificed all to destroy the god's power. The pit where Ruin's body once lay is now empty. Elend's final thought is of Vin, knowing the ultimate burden now falls to her.
