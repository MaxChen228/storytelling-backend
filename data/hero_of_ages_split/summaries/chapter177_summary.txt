Vin realizes Preservation's power chose her as its host, but Ruin's Hemalurgic spike prevented full investment until her earring was removed three times. Now fully invested, she senses Ruin's focus shift to the Pits of Hathsin. There, she discovers the kandra KanPaar unearthing the Lord Ruler's hidden atium cache. Ruin seizes control of KanPaar through his Hemalurgic spikes, declaring his intent to use the atium and proclaiming, "All of you are mine." Vin understands the Lord Ruler's thousand-year strategy to hide the atium was a profound act of preservation.

Meanwhile, Elend arrives at the Pits, seeking the refugee camp leaders. Sazed orchestrates the dramatic return of the First Generation kandra to expose KanPaar's betrayal. However, his plan is violently interrupted when TenSoon, under an external, malevolent control, attacks him. TenSoon struggles against the force, warning Sazed that "Something is very wrong" and it wants him dead. The Firsts recognize this as "The Resolution," a pre-ordained event. As TenSoon fights the control, Sazed blacks out, his fate uncertain.

The stage is set for a direct confrontation as Ruin's influence spreads and the kandra face their ultimate test.
