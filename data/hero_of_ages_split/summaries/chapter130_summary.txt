Spook grapples with feeling unchosen by Kelsier, but a memory of their friendship ignites his resolve. Rejecting his doubts, he breaks free from Sazed and plunges back into the inferno.

He extinguishes his tin, becoming numb to the searing pain and severe injuries. Driven by urgency, he pushes through the flames, reaching Sazed's hidden machine. He activates its lever, then collapses into darkness.

The true impact of Spook's sacrifice and the machine's activation will soon be revealed.
