Sazed releases their last, starving horse, a symbol of decay. He walks, burdened by guilt and despair, troubled by his meeting with Vin and Elend. He fears Vin's choice to let Elend die stems from his teachings, making him feel hypocritical, lost, and doubt-ridden.

Trekking through thick ash, Sazed seeks solace in religion. His studies of hundreds of faiths reveal only contradiction and flaws, known too intimately. Despair threatens to suffocate him.

Still, Sazed clings to hope one final religion holds truth. He relentlessly studies, knowing he *must* find answers, daring not consider what he will do if no truth exists.
