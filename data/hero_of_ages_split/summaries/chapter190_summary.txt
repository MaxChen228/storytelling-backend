Spook awakens, miraculously healed, in a crowded cavern. With Beldre and Breeze, he emerges to a world utterly transformed: lush green grass replaces ash, and a vibrant blue sky stretches overhead. They soon discover other survivors, including Ham, emerging from similar holes, realizing people from across the Final Empire have been transported. General Demoux recounts witnessing "The Survivor" glowing in the sky, orchestrating this rebirth, fulfilling Sazed's prophecy.

Following a pattern of openings, Spook leads them to the center of a field of strange, beautiful flowers. There, he finds Vin and Elend, dead but peaceful, holding hands. Beside them, Spook discovers a leather tome and a note. The note, from Sazed, reveals he is the Hero of Ages, responsible for reshaping the world. He explains he couldn't revive Vin and Elend, but assures Spook they are at peace. Sazed has left vast knowledge for rebuilding and, at Kelsier's request, has made Spook a Mistborn, healing his body.

Sazed tasks Spook with leadership, acknowledging his role in saving them all. He hints at his continued presence and mentions two unknown metals, urging Spook to investigate their secrets.
