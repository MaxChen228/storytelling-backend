Spook confronts Beldre, revealing her profound sadness is guilt over her brother Quellion’s atrocities. Quellion, a Coinshot, murders people, even children, to gather Allomancers, leaving his palace vulnerable. Spook, from the Survivor’s crew, offers Beldre a chance to join his plan to overthrow her brother, believing her defection a powerful blow.

Kelsier urges Spook to kill nearby Quellion, but Spook refuses to act in front of Beldre. She rejects his offer, threatening to scream and force him to kill her guards.

Unwilling to kill again, Spook flees as Beldre screams, leaving Quellion alive.
