Elend's New Empire forms after the Siege of Luthadel, where Vin killed Straff Venture and Shan Elariel. Penrod now governs Luthadel under Elend, who freed the Skaa. Sazed, grieving Tindwyl, serves as Elend's chief ambassador and heir, with Obligator Noorden also loyal. Spook, guilty for fleeing Luthadel, spies for Elend in Urteau, monitoring Quellion, a Survivor-follower executing nobility.

Mistsickness persists, its origins tied to Vin's power at the Well of Ascension, though exposure grants immunity. The Pits of Hathsin, Kelsier's destroyed atium source, now shelter Terris refugees. Vin is haunted by the brutal lessons of her half-brother, Reen, who died protecting her. Crucially, Vin's actions at the Well released Ruin, the ancient god of destruction and Preservation's opposite. Ruin, not yet at full power, subtly influences events, whispering to servants and altering documents, though metal remains immune. Kandra, like OreSeur (impersonating Lord Renoux), continue deceptive roles, with TenSoon now impersonating him. The Lord Ruler's hidden Storage Caverns offer cryptic advice and locations, while Ruin's subtle, growing influence promises unseen dangers.
