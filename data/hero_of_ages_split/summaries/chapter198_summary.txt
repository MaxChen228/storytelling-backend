An Allomancy nugget, a remnant of Preservation’s power, saved Elend’s life, left behind by Rashek for unknown reasons. Sazed grapples with Larstaism, a religion focused on art and supporting artists, once believed by Kelsier’s wife, Mare. He finds its doctrines lack answers about life, death, and the divine, struggling to find contradictions.

As they ride through deepening ash, Breeze observes the dreary landscape, finding the pervasive black ash "unimaginative." He playfully suggests a malevolent force behind the destruction lacks flair, proposing red or green ash would be more stylish. Sazed tries to explain the worsening ashfall and persistent mists as natural, but Breeze challenges his reasoning on the mists' unusual behavior.

Breeze then hints at the Church of the Survivor's prophecy: Vin will someday cleanse the sky and air, bringing back green plants and flowers. Sazed doubts Breeze's sincerity, yet the conversation underscores the growing mystery of their dying world. The unsettling question of the world's true decay, and Vin's prophesied role in its restoration, will soon demand answers.
