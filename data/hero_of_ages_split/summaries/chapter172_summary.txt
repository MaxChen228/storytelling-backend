The mists, it's revealed, are composed of the same power as Allomancy, explaining why burning tin allows sight through them. Vin awakens, disoriented, realizing she's dead but now floats with immense power, a god. She confronts Ruin, a shifting black smoke, and instinctively tries to save the dying world. She plugs ashmounts and clears the sky, hoping to restore life.

Her actions, however, unleash immediate devastation: the sun scorches the land, and tsunamis threaten coastal cities. Ruin intervenes, blocking her attempts to mitigate the damage. He mocks her impetuousness, revealing the Lord Ruler's past failures with the same power. Ruin explains the eternal balance between Preservation and Ruin, claiming he stops her out of "kindness" to prevent more destruction.

As people perish, Vin's vast new mind dissects Ruin's lies. She realizes he wants her to destroy and actively prevents her from learning to use her power effectively. She understands she is his true opposite, capable of saving, if only he would let her. Vin now understands the true nature of her struggle against Ruin and the immense challenge of mastering her new divine power.
