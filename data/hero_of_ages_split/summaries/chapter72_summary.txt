Vin chases a mysterious Mistborn, who vanishes after she uses a powerful duralumin Push. She realizes her secret ability to pierce copperclouds may be compromised. Rushing back to camp, she finds Elend unharmed, but he reveals the attack was a diversion.

The true target was their koloss army. Elend, Vin, and Ham survey the devastation: ten thousand koloss, half their force, lie dead. Yomen's cunning trap, using hidden trebuchets, rained destruction. Elend briefly lost control as the koloss turned on each other, setting a dangerous precedent. Yomen sacrificed equipment and soldiers, crippling Elend's most powerful asset.

With forces now evenly matched, Elend decides to move the remaining koloss closer. Vin confirms Yomen has a Mistborn, adding complexity. Elend splits control, assigning a thousand koloss to Vin. As Vin descends to take command, the immediate challenge of controlling these volatile creatures, and the looming threat of Yomen's elusive Mistborn, becomes paramount.
