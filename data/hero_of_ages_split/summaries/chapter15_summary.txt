Driven by Kelsier's legacy and disgusted by the Citizen's executions, Spook confronts Beldre, the Citizen's sister. He questions her brother's tyranny, then boldly declares his intention to kill Quellion, accusing him of perverting the Survivor's ideals. Beldre, though silent, mouths questions about his identity.

Quellion spots them and orders his guards to attack. Spook, relying on his enhanced tin senses, deftly fights the soldiers, using his dueling cane, then a fallen sword when his cane breaks. His unique sensory awareness allows him to anticipate and counter attacks, proving surprisingly dangerous despite his lack of traditional warrior training.

As Spook moves to finish the last soldier, his sword abruptly freezes mid-swing. He realizes Quellion, clutching Beldre, is Pushing against his blade with Allomancy. The Citizen, now revealed as an Allomancer, meets Spook's gaze, directly interfering. Listeners should anticipate a direct Allomantic confrontation between Spook and the Citizen.
