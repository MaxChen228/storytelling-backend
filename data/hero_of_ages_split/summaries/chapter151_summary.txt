Vin and Elend stand atop Fadrex City, observing the massive, silent koloss army amassing outside. Yomen questions their delay, but Vin knows Ruin waits for the atium. She feels immense frustration, realizing Ruin has manipulated her every move. Yet, she recalls a moment when her mist-fueled power made Ruin fearful, inspiring her to find a way to force his hand and expose him.

A devastating earthquake rocks the land, causing widespread damage and fear. Elend, however, displays a newfound confidence and balance, reassuring Yomen and Vin. This shift in Elend helps Vin solidify a desperate plan: she must put herself in extreme danger to trigger the unpredictable mist power and compel Ruin to reveal his full strategy.

Knowing she cannot speak her true intentions aloud, Vin tells Elend she must leave to "get the atium." Elend, understanding her unspoken meaning through their deep connection, trusts her. Embracing him, Vin then shoots into the ash-filled sky towards Luthadel, challenging Ruin to a chase.
