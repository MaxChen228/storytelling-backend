Elend declares the New Empire must march for Fadrex to consolidate populations and secure food in the Central Dominance. Simultaneously, they need to address the skaa rebellion in Urteau, which holds a vital grain cache and threatens to fracture the empire. Despite limited troops, Elend insists on avoiding force in Urteau. Demoux reports the rebels are harsh on noblemen, but Breeze believes they can be reasoned with. Elend tasks Breeze and Sazed with securing the Urteau cache and subduing the rebellion without violence, emphasizing bringing the people to their side.

Sazed expresses a desire for personal research, but Elend insists he lead the Urteau mission alongside Breeze, citing his unique credibility. Sazed reluctantly agrees. Elend then asks the group to describe Kelsier, the man, not the legend. They recall Kelsier as grand, genuine, inspiring, and determined, using humor as defiance. Elend feels they lack Kelsier's spirit, bickering and moping as the world ends, and believes they need his determination to face escalating challenges. The group now faces the daunting task of securing Urteau and understanding the true legacy of the Survivor.
