Ruin, trapped in the Well of Ascension, could not use Inquisitors to free himself. The Lord Ruler's control was too absolute, and even after his death, Inquisitors could not touch Preservation's power without destroying themselves. Thus, Ruin needed a more subtle approach, seeking an agent he could carefully manipulate. Meanwhile, Sazed diligently studies Urteau's underground lake, discovering how the Lord Ruler diverted water from the city's canals. He meticulously plans to reverse this, using his copperminds to access vast engineering knowledge. He aims to block the cavern's inlets, returning a powerful flow to the streets above.

Sazed finds deep contentment in his research, even in engineering, though he grapples with guilt over preferring scholarship to leadership. He reflects on his past studies with Tindwyl concerning the Hero of Ages, realizing this is the first time he's felt such excitement since then. Breeze arrives, observing Sazed's diagrams and praising his work. He encourages Sazed to embrace his passion for study, dismissing his friend's persistent guilt and noting that Sazed's renewed enthusiasm reminds him of the man he once knew.

Sazed now prepares to implement his intricate plan, hoping to bring the life-giving waters back to Urteau's parched canals.
