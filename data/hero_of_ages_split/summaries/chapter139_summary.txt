Vin enters Yomen’s chamber, observing his haggard appearance despite being Mistborn, which makes her question if he's limited to a single metal, like atium. She realizes the Lord Ruler spread misinformation and she must rely on facts. Yomen, cautious, listens as Vin reveals Elend controls koloss using emotional Allomancy enhanced by duralumin. Though skeptical, Yomen doesn't dismiss the detailed explanation, while Ruin observes Vin's strategic "game."

Vin then asserts the Lord Ruler orchestrated the discovery of five storage caverns, leading them to Fadrex City and Yomen. She appeals to his concern for the empire, emphasizing the escalating ashfall as the true, deadly threat. Yomen, visibly affected, agrees to examine maps. Vin marks the five cavern locations, noticing many mines around Fadrex City, and recalls that previous cavern sites, Vetitan and Urteau, were also mining towns.

Sensing a deeper pattern connecting the Lord Ruler's caches to metal deposits, Vin requests a map of mineral deposits. Yomen complies, hinting at a significant revelation about the caverns' true purpose.
