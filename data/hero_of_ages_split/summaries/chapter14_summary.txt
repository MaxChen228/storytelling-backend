Soldiers burn a house with "noblemen" inside, whom Spook realizes are skaa. Horrified, he feels like a coward for not acting, arguing with Durn. Durn justifies the barbarity by twisting Kelsier's teachings, claiming the Survivor advocated such destruction to build a better world. Spook feels sick, recognizing the perversion of Kelsier's message of hope into hatred.

The Citizen, Quellion, addresses the crowd after the burning, then moves to the market to bless the people. Spook, sent by Elend and Vin, uses his street skills and a blind man disguise to get close. He observes Quellion twisting Kelsier's legacy, claiming the falling ash signifies the empire's fall and the rise of a skaa nation, even as he dismisses an old woman's plea for her grandson, emphasizing the need for skaa to work.

Spook's true target is Beldre, the Citizen's sister, whose forbidden perfume hints at secrets.
