Vin realizes the destructive force at the Well of Ascension operates by rules, not as a creature, and understanding these laws is crucial to defeating it. She keeps this insight private. Elend, meanwhile, grapples with his own moral compass, fearing he mirrors the Lord Ruler. He questions his willingness to sacrifice men and besiege cities for the "greater good," acknowledging such justifications often lead to tyranny.

He reveals the brutal noble practice of beating children to force Allomantic Snapping, a method he outlawed but now regrets, seeing Allomancers as a vital resource. He wonders if his idealism is a liability, struggling with the idea that some of the Lord Ruler's "evil" actions were simply effective, perhaps needing to embrace similar harsh realities.

Vin expresses concern over Elend's hardening resolve, but he insists on finding a balance between ideals and necessity, asking her to keep him in check. The cheerful obligator Noorden then arrives with scribes and ledgers, having completed Elend's requested counts. Noorden's arrival with his completed counts suggests new information is about to surface.
