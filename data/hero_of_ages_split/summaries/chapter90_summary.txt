Vin and Elend crouch on a rooftop, aware Yomen's Mistborn shadows them from a distance. Vin, who has been staying awake to protect Elend, understands their pursuer won't attack while they are together, but his constant presence is a warning. Their mission is to infiltrate Yomen's ball at the Canton of Resource: Elend will confront Yomen, creating a crucial distraction, while Vin slips away to find the hidden storage chamber. Before they enter the austere Ministry building, Vin makes Elend promise to escape if things go wrong, emphasizing her superior skills and his need to prioritize his own safety.

They arrive at the surprisingly well-guarded building, where they are expected. Inside, the ballroom is a converted, somewhat cramped meeting hall, with several side corridors and stairwells leading down, hinting at a significant basement structure. Vin notes potential escape routes and plans to observe the party for an hour to get a feel for the layout before initiating the distraction. Elend, nervous but trusting, agrees to split up, heading towards a group of unfamiliar men. The stage is set for a tense infiltration, but Vin's observations suggest Yomen's defenses might be more complex than anticipated.
