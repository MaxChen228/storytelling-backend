Elend arrives in Luthadel to find it utterly devastated, Kredik Shaw a crater of rubble. The city is empty, much burned, and the mists are gone, replaced by an unnerving, sudden night. He struggles to comprehend the destruction and bizarre shifts, desperately seeking Vin.

At Keep Venture, Elend finds his palace a burned husk and Penrod's corpse with a suicide note. The note warns of city-wide control and directs people to the Terris Dominance. Suspecting Ruin's manipulation, Elend deduces Penrod meant the Terris *people* and their refugee camps, heading west.

Meanwhile, Vin, now wielding immense power, struggles to communicate with Elend, feeling Ruin's interference. Ruin reveals Preservation's sacrifice was a temporary measure to balance their powers by locking away a stronger part of Ruin. This fragile balance, Ruin warns, is only for a time.
