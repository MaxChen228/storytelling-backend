TenSoon surprises Sazed by calling him "The Announcer," not "Holy Witness." Sazed realizes the latter was a prophecy Ruin altered to manipulate him and Vin. TenSoon then questions what happened to Rashek's Feruchemist friends who ascended to the Well of Ascension. Breeze suggests they became nobles, but Sazed counters that Rashek, fearing Feruchemists with Allomancy, would never empower them.

TenSoon reveals Rashek, while holding the power of creation, offered his friends a bargain: immortality in exchange for their Feruchemy and humanity. These friends became the "First Generation" kandra, founders of their race. Sazed is stunned, realizing the ancient Terris religion isn't lost; it lives on, not in corrupted texts, but in the minds of these immortal kandra.

Filled with renewed hope, Sazed quickly prepares to travel with TenSoon to the kandra Homeland. TenSoon needs Sazed to convince the First Generation that "the end has arrived."
