Sazed uses a tinmind to navigate the dark cavern, soon encountering kandra guards. Though fearful, he knows kandra cannot kill humans, and his immense curiosity about their unique culture and religion, particularly their bones, takes over.

He reveals he is Sazed, a Terris Keeper, sent to speak with the First Generation. When the guards hesitate, he subtly threatens to expose their homeland's location if they refuse him entry. The startled guards agree to lead him deeper, promising a fascinating exploration of their society.
