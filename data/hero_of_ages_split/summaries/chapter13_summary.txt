Spook, disguised as a quiet beggar, sits with Durn in Urteau's Marketpit. Durn, a powerful thief lord in disguise, praises the city's new freedom from the Lord Ruler, but Spook observes the pervasive control: regulated lives, hidden deaths, and constant soldier surveillance. Spook, using his tin-enhanced senses, notes Durn's articulate speech and hidden musical talent. Both maintain their beggar guises, Spook with covered eyes, Durn with a false limp, their true purpose hidden.

A procession of soldiers escorts prisoners through the market. Spook and Durn follow, navigating the regulated crowd to a grand mansion where the Citizen, Urteau's new leader, addresses the assembled skaa. He wears newly approved red clothing, a symbol of his authority, while his sorrowful sister, Beldre, stands by his side. The Citizen proclaims Urteau a place of freedom, then points to ten prisoners, announcing their execution for defying his decree against noblemen remaining in the city.

Spook and Durn confirm the expected count of prisoners. The Citizen's speech reveals the brutal reality of his "freedom," setting the stage for their next move.
