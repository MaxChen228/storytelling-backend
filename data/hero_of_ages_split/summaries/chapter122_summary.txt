Preservation, a mere shadow of his former self, makes a final, vulnerable appearance to Elend during his trek back to Fadrex, before finally succumbing to Ruin's immense pressure and dying, unnoticed by Elend. Meanwhile, Spook meticulously outlines his plan to expose Quellion as an Allomancer. He aims to trick Quellion into publicly using his powers, perhaps by attacking him at a rally, ensuring the crowds witness his hypocrisy. Spook feels a surge of confidence, believing he can emulate Kelsier's leadership, despite his own lingering doubts.

He struggles with the burden of Beldre's captivity and the unsettling numbness he experiences when his tin burns away, trying to ignore the riots his actions are causing and relying on Kelsier's encouraging voice. Beldre, Quellion's sister, approaches him, dressed in a noble gown he provided. She finds his Eastern street slang charming, and Spook, despite his initial hesitation, reveals his plan to her.

Beldre advises against a direct attack, believing her brother won't expose himself, and instead offers to write a letter to Quellion, hoping to persuade him to listen and avoid conflict. Spook agrees, though he secretly plans to scrutinize and alter the letter to protect his position. Just as he finishes speaking with Beldre, Captain Goradel arrives with an urgent summons, hinting at an immediate, unforeseen development.
