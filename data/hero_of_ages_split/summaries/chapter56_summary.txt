Sazed reads the Lord Ruler's despairing message and a map, deepening his own hopelessness. In their cavern refuge, soldiers search for an exit. Spook joins Sazed by the black lake, revealing his Tineye abilities by removing his eye-cloth and extinguishing a lantern; his gloves hint at more.

Spook confides in Sazed, believing Kelsier's spirit watches over them. Sazed, however, has lost his faith, refusing to preach religions that offer no solace or have led to oppression, like Kelsier's deification. He no longer wears his metalminds, convinced such faiths are unworthy.

Spook astutely suggests Sazed's crisis of faith might stem from Tindwyl's disdain for religion. This observation strikes Sazed, making him wonder if he's unconsciously pursuing her interests in politics, just as she embraced his studies. Sazed resolves to continue his diligent search for truth. Spook's unique abilities and unwavering belief in Kelsier's divine presence will likely play a larger role.
