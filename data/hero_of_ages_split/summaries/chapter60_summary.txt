At a Fadrex City ball, Elend reunites with his old friend Telden, who expresses disbelief at Elend's transformation from scholar to emperor. Elend admits past failures but asserts his growth, subtly burning Iron and Zinc to control emotions and remain vigilant. He observes Vin, poised and alert, commanding attention while discreetly burning metals.

Telden confronts Elend about his imperial ambitions and the planned attack. Elend firmly states he will conquer the city if necessary, explaining the world forced him to abandon youthful idealism. He clarifies he is not the Lord Ruler, but an emperor establishing parliamentary councils, acting to reclaim an ally's city. Though Telden remains skeptical, Elend's confidence in his pragmatic leadership is unwavering, recognizing the need for stability.

Telden playfully chides Elend for not inviting him to his wedding, admiring Vin and marveling at his journey from scholar to emperor. Elend, proud of Vin and his growth, reflects on their bond. The stage is now set for Elend to prove his new resolve against Lord Yomen.
