Elend presses Yomen about the mistsickness, noting it affects exactly sixteen percent of the population. Yomen, a religious man, links "sixteen" to powerful concepts, including the true number of Allomantic metals. This sparks Elend's realization: the mists aren't killing but *Snapping* people into Allomancers, mirroring his own painful past.

He quickly tests his theory on a mistsick soldier, who successfully burns metal. As Elend confirms the mists' true purpose, a koloss army attacks. Elend deduces Ruin knows his discovery and acts immediately, ordering Yomen to gather metals for all mistsick citizens.

Elend declares these mistsick individuals are now Allomancers, ready to defend the city. He prepares to join the front lines, anticipating a desperate battle.
