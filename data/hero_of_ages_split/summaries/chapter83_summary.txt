The koloss, defying the Lord Ruler's design, demonstrate unexpected intelligence by reusing Hemalurgic spikes after his death, preventing their extinction and raising questions about their evolving humanity. Inquisitor Marsh covertly enters Luthadel, his human consciousness struggling against Ruin's control. He observes the city's decay and feels a lingering responsibility for its inhabitants, even as Ruin forces him to commit atrocities like burning food stores in other villages.

Marsh arrives at Keep Venture, noting its disrepair. His mission is to implant a small, power-leaking Hemalurgic spike into Penrod, not to grant him powers, but to allow Ruin to subtly influence his thoughts. He recalls his own traumatic transformation into an Inquisitor, a brutal process involving multiple spikes and the deaths of Allomancers, which left a painful void in his memory.

Ruin seizes direct control, guiding Marsh past guards and into Penrod's bedchamber. The aging Penrod grabs a dueling cane, ready to defend himself. Marsh draws his axe as Ruin instructs him to engage Penrod in a difficult battle, but not to kill him, ensuring Penrod believes he is successfully holding Marsh off. Listeners should anticipate the insidious psychological manipulation of Penrod and its wider implications.
