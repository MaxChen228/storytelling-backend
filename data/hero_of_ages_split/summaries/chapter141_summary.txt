Vin, furious, realizes Ruin has manipulated her emotions, driving her to seek atium, the powerful metal he desperately craves. She understands she has unwittingly led him to it. Suddenly, an Inquisitor bursts in. Vin recoils, recognizing the twisted, spiked face of Marsh, Kelsier’s brother, now fully subservient to Ruin. Marsh bows to Ruin, then demands Yomen hand over the atium he supposedly found, claiming he will secure it.

Yomen, however, reveals he only possesses seven atium beads, having misled Vin. Enraged, Ruin briefly loses his form, transforming into a tempest of blackness. Marsh then reveals Elend’s massive army, now forty thousand koloss strong, preparing to attack. Marsh declares he won't help Yomen, stating the city is doomed to burn for failing Ruin. Vin, realizing Elend intends intimidation, not destruction, boldly confronts Marsh and Ruin. She urges Yomen to defy the Inquisitor and join her, insisting they can fight these monsters together.
