The kandra's First Contract, codifying their laws, includes a chilling mass suicide clause. Now, TenSoon faces judgment before the kandra generations, led by KanPaar. Accused of killing his generation-brother OreSeur, TenSoon admits the act, arguing the Contract forbids killing humans, not kandra. He explains Zane commanded him to kill OreSeur and take his place to spy on Vin. KanPaar condemns this as a dangerous precedent, but TenSoon counters by questioning the Second Generation's decision to assign a kandra to Kelsier, the Lord Ruler's killer. KanPaar silences him, declaring this a judgment, not a trial.

KanPaar then charges TenSoon with breaking his Contract by helping Vin against his master, Zane, leading to Zane's death. TenSoon recalls Vin's unexpected mercy and understanding, which earned his loyalty. He also remembers the kandra's greatest Secret: Allomancers can control their bodies, forcing them into servitude if Contracts are broken. This vulnerability is why kandra serve. Standing tall, TenSoon defiantly declares he did *not* break his Contract, despite previous admissions. He prepares to unveil the true nature of his actions and the kandra's precarious existence.
