Wellen, a wary guard, watches the mists. A dark figure emerges. Rittle, awestruck, recognizes the figure as Kelsier, the Survivor, a fact Wellen confirms from paintings. "Kelsier" condemns the city's suffering and Penrod's cruel rule. Wellen reveals Penrod is mad, speaking to the air, forcing skaa to fight. "Kelsier" then asks for Vin and Elend. The guards don't know their location, but Wellen recalls Lord Breeze heading North to Urteau with Kelsier's crew. "Kelsier" instructs them to tell people to find immediate underground shelter when the mists leave, hinting at danger, then disappears.

The figure is TenSoon, a kandra impersonating Kelsier. Reflecting on the information, TenSoon encounters faithful citizens in a warehouse who believe he is the real Survivor. Maintaining his disguise, TenSoon warns them Penrod is corrupted by Ruin, advising escape and underground shelter via the guards. TenSoon transforms back into his wolfhound form, packs Kelsier's bones, and races North towards Urteau. Listeners can anticipate TenSoon's journey to Urteau and the unfolding dangers hinted at by the mists and Ruin.
