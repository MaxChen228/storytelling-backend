Vin watches in dread as thousands of koloss, driven by Ruin, approach the cavern for slaughter, feeling helpless to stop the deaths of those she loves. Inside, Elend delivers a powerful, somber speech, urging his men to fight with courage and honor, to make the koloss fear them and buy precious time, even in certain demise.

Elend then emerges, a lone figure in white, charging the overwhelming horde. To Vin's astonishment, he bursts with brilliant energy, moving with impossible grace and skill. He burns atium, seeing the future, joined by an army of soldiers also burning the rare metal, fighting with miraculous precision. Vin, empowered by Preservation, actively blocks Ruin's furious attempts, realizing love, life, and growth are its true defeat.

As Elend and his atium-fueled army decimate the koloss, Sazed watches from the cavern entrance, reassuring those around him that "The Hero will come."
