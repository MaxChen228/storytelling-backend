Vin discovers koloss are five souls, created with four spikes that distort their human bodies. Elend explains Inquisitors are ordinary men, like Marsh, who gain Allomantic powers by fusing many Allomancers. This explains their Misting hunts: they kill Allomancers to transfer powers via spikes and perpetuate themselves. This brutal art, drawing power from others via metals, is called Hemalurgy.

Elend reveals a larger, intelligent force is at work, citing unnaturally regular mist sickness numbers. Vin confirms koloss are humans, pierced by smaller spikes, constantly replenishing from villages. She learned new koloss are made by combining two men, creating strong creatures with broken minds. Elend connects this: the Lord Ruler used Hemalurgy to create koloss, kandra, and Inquisitors, building in weaknesses for control.

Vin's control over koloss stems from realizing they are "cousins" to kandra. Elend concludes Inquisitors, as Hemalurgic creations, must also possess a "wounded mind" weakness. This revelation offers a new strategy for confronting the Lord Ruler's most terrifying servants.
