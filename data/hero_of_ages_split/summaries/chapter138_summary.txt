Ruin struggles to spike logical minds like Elend and Yomen, who even removes a spike. In Vin's cell, Ruin, inhabiting Reen's body, gloats about the world's destruction, ignoring her questions. He reveals the Lord Ruler merely postponed ruin, inadvertently aiding him, as Ruin's power is a tool for all change.

Realizing the world is truly ending, Vin decides she must act. She calls the guards, demanding to "deal" with Yomen and offering information. The guards return and take her away. Vin now seeks to leverage her knowledge, hinting at a desperate new strategy.
