Spook awakens in his illegal Urteau lair, miraculously alive after escaping a burning building. He barely remembers the leap, but now finds his severe wounds healing at an impossible rate. He realizes he's burning pewter, a power he shouldn't possess as a Tineye. This unique combination of tin and pewter makes him an anomaly in Allomancy, and he recalls Kelsier's spirit appearing to save him, wondering if it was a hallucination.

Suddenly, Kelsier's voice instructs him to leave a sword shard embedded in his shoulder, calling it a "sign of survival." Spook grapples with his sanity, questioning if Kelsier truly watches over him, yet accepts the unsettling power it brings. Seeking answers about his crew and the city's state, Spook ventures into Urteau's hidden slums, the Harrows. Here, the Citizen's strict rule has ironically fostered a chaotic, yet surprisingly open, nighttime culture, a stark contrast to the Lord Ruler's era.

Inside a dimly lit tavern, Spook uses his enhanced senses to gather information. When offered a bottle of once-expensive, now worthless wine, he effortlessly pulls the cork with his newfound pewter strength. He embraces this power, feeling a growing confidence.
