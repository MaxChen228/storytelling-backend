Ruin's escape from the Well of Ascension is finally understood: his prison, made of Preservation's power, was unlocked when that power dispersed, rather than being used. Meanwhile, in their cavern lair beneath Urteau, Sazed, Breeze, and Allrianne are on edge. The city is tense with paranoia after Spook's dramatic vigilante act, and they worry about his prolonged absence, fearing he's either trapped or trying to protect them from implication.

Breeze speculates on Spook's transformation into a freedom fighter, praising his flair for drama in leaping from a burning building with a child. However, Sazed points out the impossible: Spook survived a two-story fall onto cobblestones without injury. Breeze dismisses the idea of Spook secretly being Mistborn, but Sazed recalls the grace of the jump, suggesting pewter-burning. He wonders if Allomancers can spontaneously gain new powers, or if drugs are involved.

Sazed struggles with his internal promise to avoid his copperminds, needing to sort truth from lies before resuming his Keeper duties. His attempts to study religion are futile, as his mind keeps returning to Spook. He senses something profoundly important is unfolding, with Spook at its heart. The mystery of Spook's new abilities and his whereabouts continues to loom large.
