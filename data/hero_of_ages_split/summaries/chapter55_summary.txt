Sazed battles a deep internal darkness and apathy, finding his usual logic useless. He questions all religions, even the flawed Church of the Survivor, yet resolves to keep searching for answers within the preserved texts, believing truth must exist.

Crucially, it details a secret Allomantic metal, electrum, offering aid against atium burners if he fails. This hidden power may soon be needed.
