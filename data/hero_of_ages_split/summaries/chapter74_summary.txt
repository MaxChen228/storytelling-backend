Hemalurgy can steal power from anyone, even normal people, granting abilities similar to Allomancy, like the kandra's Blessings of Potency, Presence, Awareness, and Stability. Meanwhile, Spook works tirelessly at a burned ruin, his pewter-enhanced body and senses allowing him to endure the harsh conditions. He reflects on the complementary nature of Allomantic pairs like tin and pewter, feeling complete with his newfound strength. He's focused on rescuing Franson's sister from execution, which is only a day away, despite having paused his dangerous spying on the Citizen.

As Franson and his men finish sifting through the debris, they uncover nine charred human skulls. Spook, who witnessed the building burn, reveals that ten people were herded inside to die. This crucial discrepancy—ten victims, but only nine skulls—gives Spook a vital clue. He now believes there's a way to get Franson's sister out.
