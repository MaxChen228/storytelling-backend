Reports describe a sentient hatred in the mists, a subtle touch of Ruin affecting some with peace, others with hostility. Below, TenSoon sits naked in an iron cage, a profound insult for a kandra who came willingly to his judgment. He reflects on his failed attempt to warn his people, feeling shame for his display and anger at the Second Generation’s rigid adherence to tradition while the world above faces catastrophe. He worries for Vin and the gods at war, while other kandra gawk at his unprecedented punishment.

MeLaan, a younger kandra, approaches his cage, expressing anger at his treatment and the Seconds' inaction. She confirms TenSoon’s fears: ash cloaks the land, mists kill during the day, and men march to war – Ruin has returned. MeLaan urges TenSoon to fight, revealing that many younger kandra are ready to rebel against the complacent leadership. She believes TenSoon, having inherited the Blessing of Potency from OreSeur, possesses the power to lead them.

TenSoon, torn between his kandra identity of order and the dire need for change, refuses to fight his own people. Yet, MeLaan insists someone must lead them, highlighting the growing unrest among the younger generations. The question of who will lead the kandra, and how, hangs heavy in the air.
