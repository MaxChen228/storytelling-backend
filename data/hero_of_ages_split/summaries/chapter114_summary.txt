The ancient pact between Preservation and Ruin, a divine stalemate, allowed for creation but promised no complete satisfaction. Ruin eventually gained the power to end the world, a power not originally bargained for. In the cavern, Spook finds Beldre by the deep lake, while Sazed and his men work to stem the water flow. Spook, hardened, observes Beldre’s profound innocence, envying her untouched nature as he offers tea, grappling with the moral weight of her capture.

Beldre reveals her past: a trusting noblewoman who believed in the Lord Ruler, only to discover her skaa heritage and face execution. The Survivor’s crew, by overthrowing the Lord Ruler, inadvertently saved her. She expresses disillusionment with Quellion, who, despite good intentions, commits harsh acts. Believing Spook might help, she came to him, only to be held captive. Spook justifies his actions for the "greater good," but Beldre notes his similarity to Quellion in their forceful nature.

Spook, feeling inadequate, downplays his role in Kelsier’s original crew, describing himself as an ignored errand boy. He clarifies that Sazed, not he, is truly in charge, merely delegating tasks. As Spook grapples with his unexpected leadership and the moral complexities of their mission, the true nature of his authority and the cost of their "greater good" remain uncertain.
