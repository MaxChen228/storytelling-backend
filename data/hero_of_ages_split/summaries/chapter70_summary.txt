Demoux reveals a precise pattern of sick remaining ill for sixteen days, linking this recurring "sixteen" to the Survivor. He theorizes the mists are the Survivor's judgment, making the sickest the most displeased, and fears his self-appointed priesthood offended him.

Elend dismisses the theory, then uses Allomancy to convince Demoux his prolonged sickness proves faithfulness is *not* a factor. He frames Demoux as a crucial counter-example, urging him to find the mists' true purpose.

Demoux agrees, but Elend immediately questions his own logic, wondering if others similarly sick are also deeply faithful. Shouting suddenly erupts.
