Vin finds the massive koloss, Human, observing the camp. His ripped blue form and red eyes are fearsome. Human insists he is "human" and desires a "house," but Vin orders him to stay with the other koloss, separate from fearful humans. Human chillingly notes humans "make us kill them instead" of attacking those who cause discomfort.

He then tells Vin she is "like us," not like them, because of the "Mist." Vin feels a chill as Human reveals his hatred for the mists, claiming they hate him. Vin, surprised, admits she feels the same, recalling a lost power over them.

Vin finally acknowledges the mists are her enemy, pulling away from her and causing death, confirming Human's unsettling insight. This revelation about the mists' true nature will undoubtedly shape her path forward.
