Rashek once tried to burn away the mists by moving the planet closer to the sun, but overshot, making the world too hot. His solution was to create the ashmounts, spewing smoke to cool the atmosphere and turn the sun red. Now, Sazed, Chief Ambassador of the New Empire, meticulously studies ancient religions, driven by grief for Tindwyl. He reviews the Canzi faith, finding it logically inconsistent regarding the divine whole and punishment through flawed bodies. He dismisses it, adding it to the hundreds of "dead" faiths in his portfolio, systematically disproving each one in search of a singular truth about the afterlife.

Breeze observes Sazed, playfully questioning his intense focus. Sazed avoids discussing his quest as they wait in an ornate room, ambassadors for Emperor Elend Venture. Their mission: secure King Lekal's allegiance through a treaty, currently being deliberated in the next room. Sazed feels a pang of hypocrisy, serving as an ambassador despite his Terris people's vow to call no man master, especially given the Lord Ruler's Terrisman heritage. Yet, he respects Elend deeply, considering him stronger than the Survivor. He hopes one of the remaining faiths will finally reveal the truth he desperately seeks.
