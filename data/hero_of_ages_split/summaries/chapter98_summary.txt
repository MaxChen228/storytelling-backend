Sazed polishes his collection of metalminds, which gleam like a treasure hoard. These metal objects, made of mundane metals, are invaluable to a Feruchemist, storing strength, memories, and knowledge. His most important copperminds hold the sum total of Keeper knowledge: histories, forgotten kingdoms, and hundreds of religions. Yet, Sazed feels profound discouragement, questioning the value of this knowledge, believing it offers no real truth or comfort in the current suffering world.

Breeze finds Sazed polishing, questioning why he cares for metalminds he no longer wears or believes in. Sazed explains that after the Lord Ruler's fall, his teaching attempts failed; people didn't care. He sees himself as the last Keeper, and the knowledge will die with him, a fact he sometimes doesn't regret. He believes scholars are useless when children starve, and wearing them now would betray his current disbelief. He wonders if Keepers should have fought instead of just memorized.

Breeze challenges Sazed, asserting that knowledge is needed most in these dark times, but Sazed remains unconvinced, questioning the purpose of teaching a god he believes doesn't exist.
