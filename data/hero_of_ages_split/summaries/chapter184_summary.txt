Elend tirelessly battles an endless koloss army, his atium-fueled mind guiding him. Despite his precision, he grows exhausted, his atium dwindles as soldiers fall. He fights alone, forced to use aggressive Allomancy, before confronting Marsh, horrifically transformed and burning atium.

Meanwhile, Human, a koloss general, is completely controlled by Ruin. Ruin guides Human and his koloss through the tunnels, bypassing others, to a specific chamber. Human bursts into a small room, finding the "thing" Ruin desperately desires. The fate of this object will shape the coming conflict.
