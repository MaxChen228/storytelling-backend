After a year of imprisonment, TenSoon is given bones and quickly reforms a human body, feeling real again despite its emaciated state. His captor, VarSell, a Fifth Generation kandra, reveals the bones are ironically ones TenSoon himself once contributed. TenSoon, a Third Generation kandra, scoffs at the Second Generation's slow pace and perceived laziness, asserting his superior skill. He observes the Blessings of Potency on his guards, an insult he finds unnecessary given his willing surrender.

As they journey through the Homeland's ancient tunnels, TenSoon reflects on his people's strange customs, their human-like forms, and their centuries of "enslavement" to Contracts. He acknowledges his betrayal of them but believes it was necessary for their survival, especially now that "the Father is dead" and their traditional way of life seems unsustainable. He aims to convince the First Generation that his actions were ultimately for the good of all kandra.

Their destination is the sacred Trustwarren, where TenSoon will face trial before the First Generation. He has spent a year preparing his defense, knowing that his success or failure will determine the future of his people. Listeners should anticipate TenSoon's pivotal trial and the revelations it may bring about the kandra's future.
