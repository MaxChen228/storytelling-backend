The world burns as Sazed finds Vin lifeless beside Elend and an unknown man. Devastated, he screams, believing all is lost. Vin's body emits white mist (Preservation) and the unknown man's black smoke (Ruin). Touching these immense, opposing powers, Sazed realizes the prophecies hinted at a Hero embodying both, feeling inadequate.

Sazed remembers the prophecy: "the Hero will bear the future of the world on his arms," looking at his copperminds. Understanding dawns. He slams his arms into the mists, absorbing Preservation and Ruin. His body evaporates as he pours all knowledge into his expanding consciousness, becoming a new entity. The Hero needed both.

Imbued with creation and destruction, Sazed must now remake a dying world.
