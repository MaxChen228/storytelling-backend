Sazed finds the kandra in an unusual state of anxiety, learning the long-lingering mists are now completely gone. KanPaar, leader of the Second Generation, dismisses this as trivial, citing kandra immortality and scolding their human-like panic.

Haddek, leader of the First Generation, interrupts, declaring this critical and that they've been "very, very wrong." He clears the Trustwarren, leaving only Sazed, and reveals a secret charge from the Father: the "Resolution." The Father made them promise to command all kandra to remove their Blessings, effectively dying by reverting to mistwraiths. Every kandra is sworn to obey.

The First Generation considers invoking the Resolution because the mists, the body of Preservation, have vanished. Rashek prophesied they would know when this day arrived, causing deep concern. Sazed questions if Preservation has returned, or if another now wields its power against Ruin.
