The kandra explain that Ruin's power, unlike Preservation's, coalesced in one specific location. Haddek reveals their "First Contract" was to gather and protect this power, Ruin's very body, anticipating his inevitable escape. Sazed, tapping a pewtermind for strength, pries open a metal dais, revealing a vast pit. Inside lies "The Trust"—thousands upon thousands of atium beads, the Lord Ruler’s secret stockpile. Haddek explains obligators secretly extracted and transported it, disguising it from Ruin and paying kandra with it. Sazed grasps that atium is not merely a metal, but concentrated divine power—Ruin’s very essence, which he will desperately seek.

Meanwhile, TenSoon, struggling through deep ash in a horse's body, finally crests a hill. He is horrified: the landscape burns, the Tyrian ashmount erupted, and plains are consumed by flowing lava. The destruction is immense, and TenSoon, overwhelmed by despair, believes it's too late to reach Fadrex.
