Vin's expanding awareness reveals glowing metal spires in Luthadel. Ruin appears, questioning Preservation's creation of "unbalanced" humans, claiming this weakened Preservation. Vin realizes Preservation gave a piece of his power (atium) to create humanity, which Ruin seeks to recover for dominance. She sees Ruin's ancient influence creating the koloss.

These koloss now converge on Luthadel. Ruin acknowledges Vin's efforts, but her attention shifts as she spots Elend flying into the city.
