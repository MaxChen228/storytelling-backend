Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host.
I'm so glad you're here.
When we last left our story, the scene was… well, it was breathtakingly desperate.
We saw Elend, a single figure in white, charge an endless army of koloss.
And then, that stunning moment of surprise.he wasn't alone.
An army of his own soldiers, all burning the god-metal atium, joined him in a perfect, future-seeing dance of battle.
It was a moment of impossible hope against certain doom.
And now, we are thrown right back into the heart of that fight.
Picture the scene.
The sun is just starting to rise, casting a hot, growing light over a battlefield that is… almost unimaginable.
Elend is standing on what the book calls a “carpet of blue corpses.” Mmm.
What a powerful and gruesome image, isn't it? Not just a pile, but a carpet.
It tells you the sheer number of koloss he has already defeated.
They cover the ground completely.
With atium guiding him, every move is perfect.
He doesn’t stumble, he doesn't hesitate.
His mind sees the attacks before they happen, and his blade is always in the right place.
He is… a perfect warrior.
But even a perfect warrior has limits.
They’ve been fighting for hours.
And while the atium makes his mind sharp, it doesn't do anything for his body.
His muscles are screaming in protest.
He's starting to feel sluggish, which means slow and with less energy.
He’s burning another metal, pewter, just to keep his body moving, but even that is not enough.
He’s becoming exhausted.
And here we get this fascinating little insight.no one has ever burned this much atium before.
Elend is in uncharted territory.
He’s pushing the limits of what a human body, even an Allomantically-powered one, can endure.
And then, the first crack in their perfect defense appears.
He glances back toward the cavern they're protecting and sees one of his atium-fueled soldiers fall in a spray of blood.
And that perfect rhythm is broken.
The horror starts to set in.
His atium is running low.
It burns so quickly, like time itself slipping away.
Another soldier screams and dies.
The dread is palpable, you can almost feel it.
There are just… so… many… koloss.
The wave is endless.
His small band of soldiers has done the impossible, slaying thousands, but it doesn’t matter.
The koloss just keep coming.
You can feel Elend's desperation building.
He starts using his other Allomantic powers, Pushing koloss away with steel, just to create a little space, a moment to breathe.
His white clothing, which was such a symbol of his pure, noble charge, is now stained completely red with blood.
He's no longer a pristine king; he's a desperate soldier covered in the grime of war.
He screams in fury and fights on, fueled by nothing but sheer will.
And then… someone new appears.
He spins, atium guiding his blade to meet a new threat, but he freezes.
This is no koloss.
It’s a figure in a black robe.
And the description… it’s chilling.
One eye socket is empty and bleeding.
The other has a spike that’s been crushed back into its skull.
It’s Marsh.
His own brother-in-law, now a Steel Inquisitor.
And the most terrifying part? Marsh has a cloud of atium shadows around him, too.
He’s also burning the metal.
This means Elend’s greatest advantage, seeing the future, is gone.
Marsh is immune.
How do you fight an enemy who can see your every move, just as you can see theirs? And just as we're left with that terrifying cliffhanger, the perspective shifts.
We are suddenly inside the mind of one of the koloss.
A creature named Human.
And this part is so… unsettling.
His thoughts are simple.
Brutal.
He is not in control of himself.
The narrative tells us something is driving him, something stronger than anything he's felt before.
It’s a being he knows by name: Ruin.
He feels no choice, no will of his own.
He can only kill.
We follow him as he and his koloss soldiers storm through the tunnels, killing everyone in their path.
But then, something strange happens.
He bursts into a large cavern filled with people.the very people Elend is dying to protect.
But Ruin, the force controlling him, makes him turn away.
It’s not that Ruin doesn't want them dead.
It’s that Ruin wants something else more.
And this overriding desire pulls Human through the crowds, over tumbled rocks, past crying people, until he reaches a small room.
He throws open the doors, and the text says, “Ruin yelled in pleasure.” Because in this room… is the one thing Ruin has been searching for.
The source of all that atium.
So we're left with this dual crisis.
Outside, Elend faces an invincible enemy in Marsh, his atium and his strength both dwindling.
The word dwindling is perfect here, it means to gradually become less or smaller.
His hope, his life, his army.it's all dwindling away.
And at the same time, deep inside the supposedly safe caverns, the enemy is at the gates of their last sanctuary, about to seize the very power that could save them all.
Now, as we look ahead, the confrontation we've been dreading is here.
Elend versus Marsh.
We're told that as his own power fades, Elend will suddenly feel a surge of phantom strength, and he'll see a vision of Vin.
What could this mean? And it all leads to a final, desperate act where Elend burns his last atium with another metal, duralumin, gaining a flash of profound, god-like knowledge in his final moments.
It seems that even in defeat, Elend has one last move to play.a sacrifice that could change the fate of the entire world by destroying the very thing Ruin wants most.
It’s a heartbreaking and truly heroic conclusion to his fight.
Thank you for joining me today.
I can’t wait to explore what happens next with you.
