Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left Elend and Vin just as they were preparing for a very important night.
Dressed in a beautiful black gown, Vin was ready to go with Elend to a grand ball in Fadrex City.
They jumped into the misty night air, leaving their friends behind.
Now, let's join them on their journey.
Imagine flying through the night sky.
But… you are wearing a very big, beautiful ball gown.
This was Vin's problem.
Allomantic jumping, which is a kind of magical jumping, was not easy in her dress.
Every time she started to fall, the dress would flare up around her.
It moved and made noise, like a group of surprised birds all flying away at once.
Now, Vin wasn't worried about people seeing what was under her dress.
It was too dark, and she was smart.
She wore leggings under all the layers of her gown.
But the dress created a problem.
The flapping fabric made it hard to steer, to control where she was going in the air.
It also made a lot of noise.
She flew over the city walls, which were made of natural rock.
She wondered what the guards on those walls thought.
To her, she sounded like many flags waving in a strong wind.
It was very loud.
Finally, she slowed down.
She aimed for a rooftop that was clean, with no ash on it.
She landed so lightly, just a soft touch.
She bounced a little and spun around, her dress flaring out beautifully.
Then she stood still, waiting for Elend.
Elend landed a moment later.
His landing was not as smooth.
It made a hard thump, and he grunted.
It wasn't because he was bad at using his powers.
He just needed more practice than Vin.
She had been doing this for years.
She thought about her own first years as an Allomancer.
Mmm… maybe she wasn't quite like him, she thought with a warm feeling.
But she was sure that many others were at Elend's level after only one year.
"That was quite a series of jumps, Vin," Elend said.
He was breathing a little heavily.
He looked back at the tall rock cliffs they had just jumped over.
Fires were burning on top of them, bright against the night sky.
Elend looked very handsome.
He wore his white military uniform, the kind Tindwyl had designed for him.
This one was perfectly clean, and he had trimmed his beard.
He looked ready for a ball.
"I couldn't land often," Vin explained simply.
"These white petticoats, the layers under my dress, will get dirty with ash very easily." She looked toward their destination.
"Come on.we need to get inside." Elend turned to her, and she could see him smiling in the dark.
He actually looked… excited.
"The dress," he said.
"Did you pay a dressmaker here in the city to make it for you?" "Actually," Vin said, "I paid a friend inside the city to have it made for me.
And to get me the makeup." She then jumped away, moving toward the castle where the ball was happening.
It was called Keep Orielle.
She stayed in the air, not landing at all, to keep her dress clean.
Elend followed right behind her.
Soon, they saw it.
In the middle of the dark mists, there was a burst of color.
It was like an aurora, one of those beautiful lights in the sky that Sazed had told her about in his stories.
The light came from the massive castle she had seen before.
Its beautiful stained-glass windows were shining from the light inside.
Vin aimed herself downward, flying fast through the mists.
For a moment, she thought about landing quietly in the courtyard, away from everyone.
That way, she and Elend could walk to the doors without anyone noticing them right away.
But then, she changed her mind.
This was not a night for being quiet and careful.
Here, I want to talk about a useful word: subtlety.
Subtlety is when you do something in a quiet, clever, or indirect way, so that people don't notice you very much.
Vin thought about using subtlety.
But she decided against it.
In other words, she chose to do the opposite.
She wanted everyone to notice.
So, instead of landing quietly, she dropped directly down onto the carpeted steps at the main entrance.
Her landing was powerful.
It blew away all the ash on the steps, creating a small, clean circle around her.
It was a very dramatic entrance.
Elend landed beside her a second later.
He stood up straight, and his brilliant white cape flapped around him.
They stood there, a perfect picture in black and white.
At the top of the steps, two servants in uniform had been greeting guests.
When they saw Vin and Elend appear from the sky, both men just… froze.
Their faces showed pure shock.
Elend held out his arm for Vin.
"Shall we?" he asked.
Vin took his arm.
"Yes," she said.
"And maybe we should hurry, before those men can call the guards." They walked confidently up the steps.
Behind them, a group of nobles getting out of a carriage made sounds of surprise.
In front, one of the servants tried to block their way.
Elend simply placed a hand on the man's chest and, using his Allomantic power, pushed him aside.
The man stumbled back into a wall.
The other servant turned and ran to get the guards.
Inside the first small room, other nobles were waiting.
They started to whisper.
Vin could hear them asking each other who these strange newcomers were.
One in black, the other in white.
Elend didn't stop.
He walked forward firmly, with Vin at his side.
People had to move out of their way.
They passed through the room quickly.
Elend gave a name card to a servant who was announcing guests into the main ballroom.
They waited.
And as they waited, Vin realized she was holding her breath.
For a moment, it felt like a dream, or maybe a memory.
She felt like that same young girl from four years ago, arriving at her very first ball.
She remembered being so nervous, so worried that she couldn't play her part correctly.
But now… she felt none of that fear.
She wasn't worried if people would accept her.
She had done amazing things.
She had defeated the Lord Ruler.
She had married Elend Venture.
And, most important of all, she had discovered who she was.
Not a street girl.
Not a noble lady.
She was someone else.
Someone she liked.
The servant read Elend's card.
His face grew pale.
He looked up at Elend, who just gave a small nod, as if to say, "Yes, it's true." The servant cleared his throat.
Then, Elend led Vin into the ballroom.
"High Emperor, Lord Elend Venture," the servant announced in a clear, loud voice.
"And the Empress Vin Venture, Heir of the Survivor, Hero of Ages." The entire ballroom went completely quiet.
It was a sudden, unnatural silence.
Vin and Elend paused at the entrance, letting all the nobles see them.
The room was beautiful.
It was made of white marble.
The ceiling was low, which made the large room feel more intimate, more personal.
There were rows of marble pillars, and large stained-glass panels stood in the middle of the room, lit from within.
It was very impressive.
"By the Lord Ruler," Elend whispered to Vin, looking at all the rich people.
"They really do think they can just ignore the rest of the world, don't they?" The nobles were covered in jewels, wearing expensive clothes.
Musicians were still playing in a corner, but no one was listening.
"Yes," Vin whispered back.
"We should move out of the doorway.
When the guards come, we’ll want to be mingled in the crowd." To mingle in the crowd means to mix with the people, to become part of the group.
This makes it harder for soldiers to attack you without hurting other nobles.
Elend smiled.
He knew she was right.
They walked down the short steps and joined the party.
The nobles of Fadrex City didn't know what to do.
So they fell back on what they knew best: proper manners.
They pretended everything was normal.
Vin and Elend had arrived, and now the real party was about to begin.
They have King Yomen's attention now.
But their plan is not over.
They must split up to make the city feel unsafe.
Vin's next job is to find allies, and she starts by approaching the most powerful-looking woman in the room.
What will she say? And how will the king react? We will find out next time.
Thank you for listening.
