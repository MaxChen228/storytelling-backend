Welcome to Storytelling Series - Intermediate Book Club Host (B1-B2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings.
Last time we were together, we left our mysterious trader, Hober Mallow, in the quiet, shadowed home of Onum Barr.
Barr, a man who has lost almost everything, had just revealed a deeply dangerous secret: his own son was plotting to assassinate the viceroy.
And just as we thought the tension couldn't get any higher, Barr turns his sharp, intelligent eyes directly on Mallow.
He asks him, almost accusingly, "And you tell this to a stranger? You endanger your son." It's such a powerful moment.
But Barr’s logic is fascinating.
He believes that by revealing this plot, he's actually helping his son by introducing a new, unknown element… a new enemy for the viceroy to worry about.
Mmm.
He sees Mallow not as a threat to his son, but as a threat to the current power structure.
And then, he reveals what he truly suspects.
There’s a feverish edge to his voice as he says he knew Mallow was different from the moment he walked in.
The reason? A personal force-shield.
You can almost feel the silence in the room as Mallow hesitates before admitting, "Yes, I had." This is where Barr, the old scholar, truly shines.
In a world that values soldiers and nuclear blasts, he has held onto knowledge.
He explains that in all of history, portable force-shields like Mallow’s have never existed.
There are massive ones for cities, yes, but not for a single person.
And he connects this to old stories… stories that were just whispers, you know? He calls them stories percolating through space.
That’s our first language cue today.
To percolate means to filter through slowly.
Imagine coffee dripping through a filter, one drop at a time.
That’s how these rumors traveled across the galaxy.slowly, changing a little with every planet they passed, telling of magicians at the edge of the galaxy who glowed in the dark and could not be harmed by weapons.
And he looks right at Mallow and essentially calls him one of these magicians.
Mallow, of course, is perfectly calm.
He simply says, "I can make nothing of all this." He gives nothing away.
But Barr seems satisfied.
He says maybe this world needs new blood, new magicians.
But then he pivots back to the viceroy, mentioning that he, too, has grand ambitions.not just to be Emperor, but perhaps to carve out a new empire of his own in the "Barbarian hinterland." And this is where Mallow shows his hand, just a little.
He changes the subject.
He asks about Siwenna's nuclear power generators.
He wants to know if they're intact.
It’s the first time he’s shown a specific, technical interest.
Barr confirms the stations are not only intact but are the best in this part of the galaxy.
But, he warns, they are impossible to get near.
The military controls some, and the city stations are controlled by the tech-men.
He describes the tech-men as a strict, hereditary guild.
You’re born into it, you die in it, and no one else gets in.
It's a wall of tradition and secrecy.
Mallow’s response is so telling.
When Barr asks if he has money to bribe them, Mallow says, "Money? No.
But does one always bribe with money?" What a fantastic question.
It suggests he has something far more valuable to offer.
Recognizing the danger Mallow is in, the old man gives him a forged passport and a crucial piece of advice.
He warns Mallow to curb his tongue, telling him his accent is "barbarous" and his speech is full of "astounding archaisms," or old-fashioned phrases.
It's another huge clue that Mallow is from a very different time or place.
And then, Mallow is gone.
But not before leaving a small, anonymous gift of strange, concentrated food for the old man who helped him.
A small act of kindness, or perhaps just tying up a loose end.
The scene shifts.
Now, picture this new character: a tech-man.
He’s described as short, plump, with glistening skin and heavy rings on his fingers.
He smells of perfume.
He is the first person Mallow has met on this planet who doesn't look hungry.
He is dripping with arrogance and self-importance.
Mallow, ever polite, mentions a gift he sent the day before.
The tech-man dismisses it as a "gewgaw." And that's our second language cue.
A gewgaw is a showy trinket that has no real value.
It's a very dismissive word, meant to put Mallow in his place.
The tech-man completely misunderstands Mallow's intentions.
He assumes Mallow is just another desperate local trying to bribe his way into the safety and privilege of the tech-man's guild.
He launches into this furious, self-righteous speech, roaring about his integrity and how he would never betray his trust.
(soft laugh) He’s so proud, so sure of his position, that he can’t see what’s really standing in front of him.
He threatens to report Mallow, marveling that he doesn't just kill him with his bare hands.
And that’s where we leave them.
Mallow, perfectly calm, facing this furious, puffed-up official who is completely, utterly wrong about everything.
The tech-man thinks he's dealing with a desperate rebel.
We know he is facing a man with technology that is centuries ahead of his own.
What happens when unshakeable confidence meets undeniable power? Well, next time, Mallow decides it’s time for a little demonstration… one that involves letting the tech-man shoot him with a blaster.
We’ll also see him back on his home planet, where his real game.a political one.is just beginning, and he comes face-to-face with his biggest rival.
Until then, happy reading.
