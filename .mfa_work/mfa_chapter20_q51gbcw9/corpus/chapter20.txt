Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2).
Last time, we left Sazed in a very dark place.
He was walking through the ash, feeling lost and full of doubt.
He was searching for a true religion, for some kind of hope, but he couldn't find it.
His heart was very, very heavy.
Today, his journey continues.
After a long time walking, Sazed and his friends arrive in a new part of the land, the Central Dominance.
And here… something is different.
Here, there is life.
People are fighting to survive.
Sazed sees fields, places where people are trying to grow food.
Can you picture it? Imagine small, weak-looking plants, just starting to grow.
But right next to them are huge piles of grey ash, taller than a person.
Every single night, more ash falls from the sky.
And every single day, workers must clear it all away just so the plants can see the sun.
They also have to carry water to the fields.
It is difficult, unending work.
This sight… it should give Sazed hope, right? But it doesn't.
Mmm, no.
He looks at the tiny plants and the giant mountains of ash, and he feels even more despair.
He thinks, how can this possibly work? How can they feed everyone? He watches the workers, the skaa.
They look tired.
They look the same as they did under the Lord Ruler.
Sazed wonders… what has really changed for them? But then, a man comes to walk beside him.
His name is Captain Goradel.
Goradel looks at the very same fields, the same workers, and he smiles.
“Seeing them gives me hope,” he says.
Sazed is surprised.
Hope? How? Goradel explains that his family were farmers.
He became a soldier because he hated the feeling of working all day on food that would just be taken away by someone else.
That feeling… it was hopelessness.
And that brings us to our language spotlight for today.
The word is hopelessness.
Hopelessness is that heavy feeling when you believe nothing good will happen.
It’s the belief that the future will be just as bad as the present.
Goradel felt hopelessness as a farmer in the old empire.
He had no hope.
But now, Goradel says, things are different.
He points to the workers.
“These people,” he says, “they work because they want to.” Sazed disagrees.
He says they work because if they don’t, they will starve.
Goradel agrees, but he adds something important.
He says they are not working because someone will beat them.
They are working so their families and friends can eat.
They are working for each other.
“There’s a difference in that,” he says.
A big difference.
Sazed listens, but he stays quiet.
He doesn’t seem to believe it yet.
Soon after, the group decides to go to the city of Luthadel for supplies.
But Sazed… Sazed says he needs to go somewhere else.
Alone.
He leaves his friends and travels for several days, all by himself, through the ash.
He arrives at a place called the Pits of Hathsin.
This was once a terrible, terrible place.
A prison where many people died.
It is the place where the hero Kelsier was born from pain and suffering.
But now… it is a home.
It is the new home for Sazed’s people, the Terris people.
Sazed looks down from a hill.
The valley that was once a prison is now filled with small villages.
His people have made it a peaceful, pastoral place.
Pastoral means a quiet, simple life in the countryside.
They are herdsmen, taking care of animals, just like their ancestors did long ago.
The plants here are strong.
They can grow even with all the ash.
The animals, a type of sheep, can eat these plants.
So, the Terris people have an easier life than the skaa farmers.
Sazed finds this very strange.
In this broken world, his people are living better than most.
As he walks down into the valley, people see him.
They run to him.
They are old men, wearing the same kind of robes as Sazed.
They call out to him.
“Lord Sazed!” one says.
Another calls him, “Your Majesty!” like he is a king.
But Sazed holds up his hands.
“Please,” he says.
“Do not call me that.” He does not see himself as a lord, or a king.
He is just Sazed, a man searching for something he has lost.
So, Sazed has found his people.
But he is still wrestling with his own feelings.
He saw the farmers, and felt only despair.
Now he sees his own people, living a quiet life, and he feels… strange.
He is still looking for an answer, a truth that makes sense of this world.
And he has not found it yet.
But while Sazed is having a quiet meal with his people, somewhere else, another one of our friends is in terrible, terrible danger.
Spook is trapped inside a burning building.
He is badly hurt and cannot move.
The fire is getting closer.
But just when all hope seems lost… he hears a voice.
A voice he knows, from a friend who is gone.
The voice promises him the strength to escape.
And it promises him… revenge.
What will happen to Spook? We will find out next time.
