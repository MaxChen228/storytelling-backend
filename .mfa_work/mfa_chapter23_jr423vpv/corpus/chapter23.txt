Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)! Last time, we left TenSoon in a cage, judged by his own people, while MeLaan urged him to lead a rebellion against the elders as the world outside faced ruin.
It was such a tense moment.
He was torn between his duty and the obvious need for action.
And MeLaan is not letting him off the hook.
Not at all.
She starts this conversation with such a heavy, pointed statement.
She looks at him and says, 'So, you just came to die.' Wow.
That's.
that's not a question, is it? It’s an accusation.
She’s basically saying he has given up.
Exactly.
And TenSoon's defense is so interesting.
He says, 'I came to be the best kandra I know how.' But for him, that means accepting punishment, following the old traditions.
But MeLaan sees it differently.
For her, being the best kandra right now means fighting back! She immediately pushes him, 'Then fight!' When he refuses, she brings up something from his past.
A rumor.
She says, 'The others of my generation, they said that you were broken by that last master of yours.
The man Zane.' Oof.
That's a low blow.
She’s suggesting he’s not just making a choice, but that he’s.
damaged.
That his spirit is weak because of what Zane did to him.
She even connects it to the body he returned in.
She asks why he came back in.
a dog's body.
As if that was proof of his brokenness.
But TenSoon corrects her on that point, and it feels so important.
He says the dog's bones weren't from Zane.
'Those were given to me by Vin.' It's a huge distinction! His time in that body wasn't a symbol of his humiliation by a villain.
it was part of a bond with a hero.
It was about learning and loyalty.
But MeLaan just can't see it.
She replies, 'So she broke you.' For her, any deviation from their tradition, any deep connection to a human, is a form of being broken.
You can almost feel TenSoon’s frustration.
The text says, 'How could he explain?' He knows she sees his choice as distasteful, even though she herself wears a body that is intentionally inhuman.
It's a total disconnect.
He's had this life-changing experience, and he can't even begin to communicate it to his own people.
They just don't have the words or the context for it.
So he pulls back.
He decides, no, he didn't come to start a revolution.
He came to accept his punishment.
And yet.
you can see a little crack in that resolve.
Oh, that moment! It’s so subtle.
He suddenly asks her, 'Those bones I wore.
You know where they are?' Yes! It’s just for a second.
A hint of a plan.
He’s testing the waters, seeing if there might be a way out, even if he's not sure he wants one.
And he immediately covers his tracks! When she asks why he'd want them, he says, 'I don’t! They were disgraceful! Humiliating!' He builds this whole story about how he was forced to wear them.
It’s a clever performance.
He’s trying to protect MeLaan by pushing her away.
He tells her, 'Please, if you truly wish to help me, just let me be.' He doesn't want her to be punished for talking to him.
It’s a sacrifice, in a way.
He's choosing his duty to protect her over his own potential freedom.
It’s very… kandra of him.
It is.
And as MeLaan leaves, she says something that must have hurt him deeply.
'You were once the greatest of us.' She’s talking about him in the past tense.
Like the hero she admired is already gone.
It's so final, so sad.
And what's even sadder is that TenSoon agrees with her, but for different reasons.
He thinks to himself that he was never great.
He says he was just… orthodox.
A conservative.
And now? Now he sees himself as the greatest criminal in their history, but he feels it all happened by accident.
His final thought is just devastating: 'That isn’t greatness.
That’s just foolishness.' He has no sense of his own worth right now.
He’s completely lost between the old world he knew and the new one he's discovered, and he feels like a failure in both.
It leaves him in such a dark place.
Alone in that cage, with only his regrets.
And while TenSoon sits in that darkness, our story will shift back to Vin and Elend.
They are on a boat, facing a world where the mists themselves have become deadly, and Vin is grappling with the terrible entity she accidentally released from the Well of Ascension.
She's turning to books, to knowledge, trying to understand the rules of this new, terrible game.
She’s looking for a way to fight an enemy that can alter reality itself.
That's right.
Join us next time for Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) as Vin searches for answers and discovers the first, fundamental rule that governs Ruin's power.
Thank you for listening.
