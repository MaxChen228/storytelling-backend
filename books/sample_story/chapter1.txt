THE CLOCKWORK FOREST
The rain had polished the abandoned rails until they shone like threads of mercury. Mira adjusted the strap of her satchel and kept walking, counting the seconds between the distant thunder and the glow that pulsed beneath the trees. The glow always came first in her grandmother's stories; seeing it for herself made the hairs on her arm rise.

Every ten steps she whispered a new English word, a habit she had adopted to keep calm while practicing. "Gleam." "Echo." "Courage." Each word floated with the mist, stitching language into her memory.

A fox made of brass gears watched her from a mossy rock. Its eyes flickered, remembering, perhaps, the last visitor who dared to enter the Clockwork Forest. Mira bowed politely. "I'm only here for a story," she said. The fox tilted its head, then leapt away, leaving a swirl of sparks as a silent blessing.
