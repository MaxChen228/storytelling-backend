    "text": "<speak> Welcome to Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2) - Immersive single-narrator book retellings! Today, we're starting a brand-new adventure, diving into the amazing story behind Isaac Asimov's \"Foundation\" series."
  },
  {
    "text": "Since we don't have a previous chapter summary, we're beginning right at the very start, with the author himself telling us how this huge universe came to be. It's like finding the very first seed of a giant tree! Now, imagine this with me. The year is 1941, August 1st."
  },
  {
    "text": "Can you picture it? Europe is in flames. World War II has been raging for two years already. France has fallen. The Battle of Britain was fought. The Soviet Union... it was just invaded by Nazi Germany."
  },
  {
    "text": "The evil shadow of Adolf Hitler seemed to be falling over the whole world. It was a very scary time, a very uncertain time. But on that very day, with all this happening, Isaac Asimov, our author, had something else chiefly on his mind. He was just twenty-one years old."
  },
  {
    "text": "A graduate student studying chemistry at Columbia University. And he was also writing science fiction! He had been doing it professionally for three years. He was hastening to a meeting. He had an appointment with his editor, John Campbell. He needed to tell him the plot of a new story."
  },
  {
    "text": "(soft laugh) And here's the funny part: he had no plot in mind! Not even a tiny idea. Can you imagine the pressure? You're a young writer, going to meet your boss, and you have nothing to show! So, he tried a clever trick. A device he sometimes used."
  },
  {
    "text": "He just opened a book, any book, at random. And he started to think, to free-associate, from whatever he saw first. The book he had was a collection of Gilbert and Sullivan plays. He opened it, and what did he see?"
  },
  {
    "text": "A picture of the Fairy Queen throwing herself at the feet of a soldier, Private Willis. This made him think of soldiers... of military empires! Like the Roman Empire. And then, aha! A Galactic Empire!"
  },
  {
    "text": "He thought, \"Why shouldn't I write about the fall of a Galactic Empire?\" Just like how the Roman Empire fell, but... in space! He had read a famous book, Gibbon's \"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\" not once, but twice!"
  },
  {
    "text": "So, the idea was bubbling inside him by the time he got to Campbell's office. His excitement, um, it was contagious! Campbell got excited too. In just one hour, they built up this huge idea. A vast series of connected stories!"
  },
  {
    "text": "They would cover a thousand-year period between two Galactic Empires. And they even thought of a new science: psychohistory. This science could predict the future of many, many people, on a galactic scale!"
  },
  {
    "text": "So, on August 11, 1941, he started writing the first story, calling it \"Foundation.\" In it, he described Hari Seldon, the psychohistorian. Seldon set up two special \"Foundations\" at different ends of the Universe. Why? To make sure that a second Empire would rise in just one thousand years."
  },
  {
    "text": "Otherwise, it would take thirty thousand years! He submitted this story, and to make sure Campbell would buy more, he ended it on a cliff-hanger! He really wanted to force Campbell to ask for a second story. But then, he ran into trouble."
  },
  {
    "text": "When he started the second story, he quickly wrote himself into an impasse. He was stuck! The series almost died right there. But a friend, Fred Pohl, helped him out. Just a conversation on the Brooklyn Bridge, and Fred's words pulled him out of that hole. The series continued!"
  },
  {
    "text": "Let's pause here for a moment and look at two words from this part of the story. First, \"hastening.\" H-A-S-T-E-N-I-N-G. Asimov was \"hastening\" to his meeting. This means <lang xml:lang='zh-CN'>急忙趕去 (jí máng gǎn qù). It means going somewhere very quickly, in a hurry."
  },
  {
    "text": "Can you imagine yourself hastening to somewhere important, maybe a test or a fun event? The second word is \"impasse.\" I-M-P-A-S-S-E. He wrote himself into an impasse. This means <lang xml:lang='zh-CN'>僵局 (jiāng jú)."
  },
  {
    "text": "It's a situation where you can't move forward, you're stuck, um, like a road with no way out. So, he was hastening, full of ideas, but then he hit an impasse, a real block! So, what's the big takeaway from this first part of Isaac Asimov's story?"
  },
  {
    "text": "We learned how a huge science fiction series, the \"Foundation,\" was born from a small, random spark of an idea during a time of global war. Asimov, a young writer, faced challenges, like getting stuck and having no plot, but his creativity and conversations with others helped him overcome them."
  },
  {
    "text": "He even used a cliff-hanger to keep his editor interested! The Foundation series grew and grew. It became very famous, even winning a Hugo Award for the best all-time series! But, um, here's a little secret, a hint for what's coming next."
  },
  {
    "text": "Asimov confesses that when he wrote a later Foundation novel, he deliberately left one small plot point unresolved. He hoped no one else would notice it! Why? Because it clearly points the way to even more stories! He even wrote \"The End (for now)\" at the end of that novel."
  },
  {
    "text": "This means the story is never truly finished, right? Next time, we will meet a young mathematician named Gaal Dornick. He travels from a planet called Synnax all the way to Trantor, the magnificent capital of the Galactic Empire. This Empire rules twenty-five million planets!"
  },
  {
    "text": "Gaal is coming to join the mysterious Psychohistory Project of the legendary Hari Seldon. Can you imagine arriving at a planet so incredibly big, so bustling, that it makes you feel tiny and overwhelmed? What secrets will Gaal discover there?"
  },
  {
    "text": "Thank you for joining me today on 'Storytelling Series - Beginner Story Guide (A2)'. I can't wait to explore more of the 'Foundation' universe with you next time! Goodbye for now!"
